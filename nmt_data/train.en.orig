Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
In 4 minutes , atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change , with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule .
I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change , and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science .
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system .
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers , from 113 countries .
It &apos;s a big community . It &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
And every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics .
For us at Cambridge , it &apos;s as varied as the El Niño oscillation , which affects weather and climate , to the assimilation of satellite data , to emissions from crops that produce biofuels , which is what I happen to study .
And in each one of these research areas , of which there are even more , there are PhD students , like me , and we study incredibly narrow topics , things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules .
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene , which is here . It &apos;s a small organic molecule . You &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .
But despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
It &apos;s a huge amount of stuff . It &apos;s equal to the weight of methane .
And because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmospheric system .
Because it &apos;s important to the atmospheric system , we go to all lengths to study this thing .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
Atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
But still , we look at the pieces .
We run enormous models on supercomputers ; this is what I happen to do .
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what &apos;s happening .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia . There are others .
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there .
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .
And this is the tower from below .
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .
And this plane , the model , BA146 , which was run by FAAM , normally flies 120 to 130 people .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
But we didn &apos;t just fly it . We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff .
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
And as you come around the banks in these valleys , the forces can get up to two Gs .
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they &apos;re on board .
So , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft doesn &apos;t look like any plane you would take on vacation .
It &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
And out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
And as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others .
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
In each one of those assessments that we write , we always tag on a summary , and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience .
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
Neuroscientist and inventor Christopher deCharms demonstrates a new way to use fMRI to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . In other words , you can actually see how you feel .
Hi . I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave .
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
Well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that .
People envision this as being very difficult .
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
We don &apos;t have to inject anything . We don &apos;t need radiation .
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter &apos;s mind taking place .
Now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
What &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
We &apos;ve collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he &apos;s inside the scanner .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
If he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
Chronic pain is an example . If you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
But if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
If we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain , we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .
What you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
This may shock you , but we &apos;re literally reading this person &apos;s brain in real time .
They &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
They &apos;re learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .
As they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
This is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients .
This is not &quot; The Matrix . &quot; You can only do this to yourself . You take control .
I &apos;ve seen inside my brain . You will too , soon .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences .
These are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that I don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
But I want to leave with you the big question .
We are the first generation that &apos;s going to be able to enter into , using this technology , the human mind and brain .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
Movies have the power to create a shared narrative experience and to shape memories and worldviews . British film director Beeban Kidron invokes iconic film scenes -- from &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; Miracle in Milan &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; to &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; Boyz n the Hood &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; -- as she shows how her group FILMCLUB shares great films with kids .
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form .
From mother to daughter , preacher to congregant , teacher to pupil , storyteller to audience .
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet , human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable .
We are inveterate storytellers .
But where , in our increasingly secular and fragmented world , do we offer communality of experience , unmediated by our own furious consumerism ?
And what narrative , what history , what identity , what moral code are we imparting to our young ?
Cinema is arguably the 20th century &apos;s most influential art form .
Its artists told stories across national boundaries , in as many languages , genres and philosophies as one can imagine .
Indeed , it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle .
During the last decade we &apos;ve seen a vast integration of global media , now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster .
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
As a human being , it puts the fear of God in me .
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they &apos;ve come from and so few narratives of what &apos;s possible ?
The irony is palpable ; technical access has never been greater , cultural access never weaker .
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB , an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions .
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film , maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young .
Given the access to technology , even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board .
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K. , with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes .
The films were curated and contextualized .
But the choice was theirs , and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide .
The outcome , immediate .
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three , these young people discovered new places , new thoughts , new perspectives .
By the time the pilot had finished , we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join .
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica , &quot; Miracle in Milan . &quot;
It &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father &apos;s 50th birthday .
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema , find and pay for the print and the projectionist .
But for my father , the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica &apos;s vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends , &quot; In order , &quot; he said , &quot; to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation . &quot;
In the last shot of &quot; Miracle in Milan , &quot; slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms .
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it , I see young faces tilt up in awe , their incredulity matching mine .
And the speed with which they associate it with &quot; Slumdog Millionaire &quot; or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature .
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government , we screened &quot; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . &quot;
Made in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grandparents .
Frank Capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
It shows how to do right , how to be heroically awkward .
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
Shortly after &quot; Mr. Smith &quot; became a FILMCLUB classic , there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords .
And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle .
After all , Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
In choosing &quot; Hotel Rwanda , &quot; they explored genocide of the most brutal kind .
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
And when &quot; Schindler &apos;s List &quot; demanded that they never forget , one child , full of the pain of consciousness , remarked , &quot; We already forgot , otherwise how did &apos; Hotel Rwanda &apos; happen ? &quot;
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons , but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity , unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier &apos;s careful tutelage .
By now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week .
From 25 clubs , we became hundreds , then thousands , until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country .
And although the numbers were , and continue to be , extraordinary , what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life .
Some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
And those without friends started making them .
The films provided communality across all manner of divide .
And the stories they held provided a shared experience .
&quot; Persepolis &quot; brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother , and &quot; Jaws &quot; became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he &apos;d experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey .
Who was right , who wrong ?
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
How has the world changed ? How could it be different ?
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn &apos;t think were interested .
And they themselves had not known they cared .
And as they wrote and debated , rather than seeing the films as artifacts , they began to see themselves .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers .
Quite recently she told me that in 1948 , two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents .
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
My mother &apos;s mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
After two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in London .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents .
I had &quot; Anne Frank , &quot; &quot; The Great Escape , &quot; &quot; Shoah , &quot; &quot; Triumph of the Will . &quot;
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure .
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt &apos;s wrist .
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
As one 12-year-old said after watching &quot; Wizard of Oz , &quot; &quot; Every person should watch this , because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart . &quot;
We honor reading , why not honor watching with the same passion ?
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
Agree that &quot; Boyz n the Hood , &quot; like Tennyson , offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together .
Each a piece of memorable art , each a brick in the wall of who we are .
And it &apos;s okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley &apos;s face superimposed onto that of Gandhi &apos;s .
And though not real , Eve Harrington , Howard Beale , Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human , and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England .
We guessed that film , whose stories are a meeting place of drama , music , literature and human experience , would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB .
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior , confidence and academic achievement .
Once-reluctant students now race to school , talk to their teachers , fight , not on the playground , but to choose next week &apos;s film -- young people who have found self-definition , ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed .
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
They are , like other young people , negotiating a world with infinite choice , but little culture of how to find meaningful experience .
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes , yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered .
If we want different values we have to tell a different story , a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person &apos;s identity , that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity , and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group .
Because when these people get home after a screening of &quot; Rear Window &quot; and raise their gaze to the building next door , they have the tools to wonder who , apart from them , is out there and what is their story .
Thank you .
Ellen Jorgensen : Biohacking -- you can do it , too
We have personal computing , why not personal biotech ? That &apos;s the question biologist Ellen Jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening Genspace , a nonprofit DIYbio lab in Brooklyn devoted to citizen science , where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology . Far from being a sinister Frankenstein &apos;s lab , Genspace offers a long list of fun , creative and practical uses for DIYbio .
It &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
By the end of this year , we &apos;ll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros .
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector .
It has the power , potentially , to replace our fossil fuels , to revolutionize medicine , and to touch every aspect of our daily lives .
So who gets to do it ?
I think we &apos;d all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it .
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
It &apos;s a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate , it could really stimulate innovation .
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they &apos;ve got the best idea of what their needs are .
And here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
So wouldn &apos;t it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff , do it hands-on ?
I thought so .
So , three years ago , I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace .
It &apos;s a nonprofit , a community biotech lab in Brooklyn , New York , and the idea was people could come , they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open , friendly atmosphere .
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next . Can you guess ?
The press started calling us .
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy , the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein , and as a result , for the next six months , when you Googled my name , instead of getting my scientific papers , you got this .
&#91; &quot; Am I a biohazard ? &quot; &#93; It was pretty depressing .
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world , there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were .
They were opening biohacker spaces , and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did , more regulations , less resources .
But now , three years later , here &apos;s where we stand .
It &apos;s a vibrant , global community of hackerspaces , and this is just the beginning .
These are some of the biggest ones , and there are others opening every day .
There &apos;s one probably going to open up in Moscow , one in South Korea , and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We work in groups , in big cities — — and in small villages .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We hack hardware , software , wetware , and , of course , the code of life .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
The spirit of these labs , it &apos;s open , it &apos;s positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use , and , you know , you get something like synthetic biology , nanobiotechnology , it really compels you , you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups , because they have better infrastructure , they have better facilities , and they have access to pathogens .
So the United Nations did just that , and they recently issued a report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative , and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics .
As a matter of fact , DIY people from all over the world , America , Europe , got together last year , and we hammered out a common code of ethics .
That &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
We dispose of our waste properly , we follow safety procedures , we don &apos;t work with pathogens .
You know , if you &apos;re working with a pathogen , you &apos;re not part of the biohacker community , you &apos;re part of the bioterrorist community , I &apos;m sorry .
And sometimes people ask me , &quot; Well , what about an accident ? &quot;
Well , working with the safe organisms that we normally work with , the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating , like , some sort of superbug , that &apos;s literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert .
Now , it could happen , but I &apos;m not going to plan my life around it .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
It &apos;s a study at Harvard where , at the end of the study , they &apos;re going to take my entire genomic sequence , all of my medical information , and my identity , and they &apos;re going to post it online for everyone to see .
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion .
The one I liked the best is , someone could download my sequence , go back to the lab , synthesize some fake Ellen DNA , and plant it at a crime scene .
But like DIYbio , the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk .
Now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; Well , you know , what would I do in a biolab ? &quot;
Well , it wasn &apos;t that long ago we were asking , &quot; Well , what would anyone do with a personal computer ? &quot;
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Let me show you what you could do right now .
A biohacker in Germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street ?
Yep , you guessed it . He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs , analyzed the saliva , identified the dog , and confronted the dog owner .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
And the same kind of technology -- it &apos;s called DNA barcoding , it &apos;s really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
In a biohacker space , you can analyze your genome for mutations .
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO &apos;s , and you can explore your ancestry .
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what &apos;s up there .
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
You can also do an art science project . Some of these are really spectacular , and they look at social , ecological problems from a completely different perspective .
It &apos;s really cool .
Some people ask me , well , why am I involved ?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
The thing is , there &apos;s something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can &apos;t find anywhere else .
There &apos;s something sacred about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justify to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save mankind , or even that it &apos;s feasible .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
If you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do biotech .
It &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
Why not personal biotech ?
If everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
This is such a new area , and as we say back in Brooklyn , you ain &apos;t seen nothin &apos; yet .
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
In this engaging talk , world champion whistler Geert Chatrou performs the whimsical &quot; Eleonora &quot; by A. Honhoff , and his own &quot; Fête de la Belle . &quot; In a fascinating interlude , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
What is a chubby , curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling ?
Well actually , I &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whistling since the age of four , about four .
My dad was always whistling around the house , and I just thought that &apos;s part of communication in my family .
So I whistled along with him .
And actually , till I was 34 , I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling , because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
I whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . I whistled everywhere .
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law .
And they had some , in my opinion , terrible Christmas music .
And when I hear music that I don &apos;t like , I try to make it better .
So &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it &apos;s very annoying .
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times , &quot; Please stop whistling . &quot;
And I just couldn &apos;t .
And at one point -- and I had some wine , I have to admit that -- at one point I said , &quot; If there was a contest , I would join . &quot;
And two weeks later I received a text message : &quot; You &apos;re going to America . &quot;
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She Googled , and she found this World Whistling Championship in America , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
So I went to Louisburg , North Carolina , southeast United States , and I entered the world of whistling .
And I also entered the world championship , and I won there in 2004 .
That was great fun , of course .
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and I won again .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan , Tokyo , and I won again .
So what happened now is I &apos;m standing here in Rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and I &apos;m talking about whistling .
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
And I try to live my dream -- well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
And then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , &quot; Oh , my God .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
The track that I will whistle is called &quot; Fête de la Belle . &quot;
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
And if it &apos;s started , I just point where you whistle along , and we will see what happens .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .

Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Roberto D &apos;Angelo + Francesca Fedeli : In our baby &apos;s illness , a life lesson
Roberto D &apos;Angelo and Francesca Fedeli thought their baby boy Mario was healthy -- until at 10 days old , they discovered he &apos;d had a perinatal stroke . With Mario unable to control the left side of his body , they grappled with tough questions : Would he be &quot; normal ? &quot; Could he live a full life ? The poignant story of parents facing their fears -- and how they turned them around .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
He was born two and a half years ago , and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for , like , eight months .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
But at the end , 10 days later after he was born , we discovered that he had a stroke .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
Just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer doesn &apos;t have the right drives , so the same is for Mario .
It &apos;s just like , he would like to move his left side of his body , but he &apos;s not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
And that has been really a tough time .
Questions , some basics , like , you know , why did this happen to us ?
And what went wrong ?
Some more tough , like , really , what will be the impact on Mario &apos;s life ?
I mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
And , you know , as a parent , especially for the first time , why is he not going to be better than us ?
And this , indeed , really is tough to say , but a few months later , we realized that we were really feeling like a failure .
I mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
And you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
Honestly , we went down .
I mean we went really down , but at the end , we started to look at him , and we said , we have to react .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
We started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
You have an object , and we showed him how to grab the object .
Now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And the problem , as you might feel , is that we were down , we were depressed , we were looking at him as a problem , not as a son , not from a positive perspective .
And that day really changed our perspective .
We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario .
We restarted from our strengths , and at the same time we restarted from his strengths .
We stopped looking at him as a problem , and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve .
And really , this was the change , and from our side , we said , &quot; What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario ? &quot;
And we started from our passions .
I mean , at the end , my wife and myself are quite different , but we have many things in common .
We love to travel , we love music , we love to be in places like this , and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him .
This short video is from last week .
I am not saying -- — I am not saying it &apos;s a miracle . That &apos;s not the message , because we are just at the beginning of the path .
But we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that Mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
And this is the message that we want to share with you .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And this is why -- — And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him .
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Mark Shaw demos Ultra-Ever Dry , a liquid-repellent coating that acts as an astonishingly powerful shield against water and water-based materials . At the nano level , the spray covers a surface with an umbrella of air so that water bounces right off . Watch for an exciting two-minute kicker .
I &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
You &apos;re about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that &apos;s going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
What I have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
It &apos;s called Ultra-Ever Dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield .
So this is a cinder block , uncoated , and you can see that it &apos;s porous , it absorbs water .
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
The rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it &apos;s really round , it &apos;s superhydrophobic .
A freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees .
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
But what you &apos;re seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic .
So as part of the demonstration , what I have is a pair of gloves , and we &apos;ve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and I &apos;ll give you a hint .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what &apos;s occurred is that we &apos;re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you &apos;d be the width of a human hair .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
It &apos;s a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
You can see the difference .
Moving onto the next demonstration , we &apos;ve taken a pane of glass and we &apos;ve coated the outside of it , we &apos;ve framed it with the nanotechnology coating , and we &apos;re going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle , and you &apos;re going to see , it &apos;s going to spread out on glass like you &apos;d normally think it would , except when it hits the coating , it stops , and I can &apos;t even coax it to leave .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
Well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface .
You &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
And it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
It &apos;s an umbrella of air all across it , and that layer of air is what the water hits , the mud hits , the concrete hits , and it glides right off .
So if I put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it &apos;s dry .
So what are the applications ?
I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
Everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , &quot; Oh , I could use it for this and this and this . &quot;
The applications in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-wetting .
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anything that &apos;s anti-icing , because if you don &apos;t have water , you don &apos;t have ice .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well .
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before I do that , I would like to say thank you , and think small .
It &apos;s going to happen . Wait for it . Wait for it .
You guys didn &apos;t hear about us cutting out the Design from TED ?
&#91; Two minutes later ... &#93; He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part .
It &apos;s happening !

Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code
Behavioral economist Dan Ariely studies the bugs in our moral code : the hidden reasons we think it &apos;s OK to cheat or steal . Clever studies help make his point that we &apos;re predictably irrational -- and can be influenced in ways we can &apos;t grasp .
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality .
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital .
I was burned very badly .
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you &apos;ll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me .
Now , you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what &apos;s the right approach .
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip .
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned , it would take about an hour .
And as you can imagine , I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity .
And I would try to reason with them and say , &quot; Why don &apos;t we try something else ?
Why don &apos;t we take it a little longer -- maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity ? &quot;
And the nurses told me two things .
They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
It &apos;s in every language I &apos;ve had experience with so far .
And , you know , there &apos;s not much -- there wasn &apos;t much I could do , and they kept on doing what they were doing .
And about three years later , when I left the hospital , I started studying at the university .
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients .
So originally I didn &apos;t have much money , so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter &apos;s vice .
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it , and I would crunch it a little bit .
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain .
And when I finished hurting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? Or , how painful was this ?
Or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
I kept on doing this for a while .
And then , like all good academic projects , I got more funding .
I moved to sounds , electrical shocks -- I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain .
But at the end of this process , what I learned was that the nurses were wrong .
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time .
It turns out that because we don &apos;t encode duration in the way that we encode intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face , which was much more painful , and move toward my legs , giving me a trend of improvement over time -- that would have been also less painful .
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain .
All of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea .
And from that point on I started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
And it turns out it &apos;s a more general case -- there &apos;s a lot of mistakes we do .
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities , and I want to talk to you about cheating .
And the reason I picked cheating is because it &apos;s interesting , but also it tells us something , I think , about the stock market situation we &apos;re in .
So , my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene , exploded all of a sudden , and I started thinking about what is happening here .
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ?
So , like we usually do , I decided to do a simple experiment .
And here &apos;s how it went .
If you were in the experiment , I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve , but I wouldn &apos;t give you enough time .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; Pass me the sheets of paper , and I &apos;ll pay you a dollar per question . &quot;
People did this . I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; Please shred the piece of paper .
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack , and tell me how many questions you got correctly . &quot;
People now solved seven questions on average .
Now , it wasn &apos;t as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot .
Instead , what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .
Now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it &apos;s worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
So , we try to test this .
For some people , we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal .
We paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases , people would cheat more , but in fact it wasn &apos;t the case .
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper , so there was some evidence left .
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
Some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars .
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down , people would cheat more , but again , this was not the case .
Again , a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit , and they were insensitive to these economic incentives .
So we said , &quot; If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations , to these forces , what could be going on ? &quot;
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces .
At one hand , we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves , so we don &apos;t want to cheat .
On the other hand , we can cheat a little bit , and still feel good about ourselves .
So , maybe what is happening is that there &apos;s a level of cheating we can &apos;t go over , but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree , as long as it doesn &apos;t change our impressions about ourselves .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Initially we said , what can we do to shrink the fudge factor ?
So , we got people to the lab , and we said , &quot; We have two tasks for you today . &quot;
First , we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school , or to recall The Ten Commandments , and then we tempted them with cheating .
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
It wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any Commandments -- cheated more .
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments , they stopped cheating .
In fact , even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat , they don &apos;t cheat at all .
Now , Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
So , we got people to sign , &quot; I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code . &quot;
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
And this is particularly interesting , because MIT doesn &apos;t have an honor code .
So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators ?
As you can expect it doesn &apos;t last very long ; people take it .
In contrast , I took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and I left those plates in the same refrigerators .
No bill ever disappeared .
Now , this is not a good social science experiment , so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before .
A third of the people we passed the sheet , they gave it back to us .
A third of the people we passed it to , they shredded it , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr. Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X dollars . &quot;
A third of the people , when they finished shredding the piece of paper , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X tokens . &quot;
We did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
And then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and exchanged it for dollars .
Think about the following intuition .
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
These things feel very differently .
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
I &apos;ll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute .
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet , because in Enron , there &apos;s also a social element .
People see each other behaving .
In fact , every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we prepaid them .
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment , and we told them that at the end , we asked them to pay us back the money they didn &apos;t make . OK ?
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds , and said , &quot; I solved everything . What do I do now ? &quot;
And the experimenter said , &quot; If you &apos;ve finished everything , go home .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
So , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they &apos;re wearing .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities , Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh .
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group , cheating went up .
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt , cheating went down .
Now , this is important , because remember , when the moment the student stood up , it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating , because the experimenter said , &quot; You &apos;ve finished everything . Go home , &quot; and they went with the money .
So it wasn &apos;t so much about the probability of being caught again .
It was about the norms for cheating .
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating , we feel it &apos;s more appropriate , as a group , to behave this way .
But if it &apos;s somebody from another group , these terrible people -- I mean , not terrible in this -- but somebody we don &apos;t want to associate ourselves with , from another university , another group , all of a sudden people &apos;s awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
When we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more .
And when we see cheating around us , particularly if it &apos;s a part of our in-group , cheating goes up .
Now , if we think about this in terms of the stock market , think about what happens .
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
What happens when you do other things , like you remove things from money ?
You call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
Could it be that with those more distant things , it &apos;s not a token for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more ?
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them ?
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
More generally , I want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
We have many intuitions in our life , and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
We can think about how we &apos;re going to test this intuition in our private life , in our business life , and most particularly when it goes to policy , when we think about things like No Child Left Behind , when you create new stock markets , when you create other policies -- taxation , health care and so on .
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages .
And I learned two interesting things .
One was that my favorite nurse , Ettie , told me that I did not take her pain into consideration .
She said , &quot; Of course , you know , it was very painful for you .
But think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody I liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time .
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me , too . &quot;
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
But it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , &quot; I did not think that your intuition was right .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
So , if you think about all of your intuitions , it &apos;s very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong .
And she said , &quot; Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ... &quot; -- she thought her intuition was right -- it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong .
But in fact , this is the situation we &apos;re all in all the time .
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability , how the economy works , how we should pay school teachers .
But unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
Thank you very much .
Jane McGonigal : Massively multi-player … thumb-wrestling ?
What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another ? Chaos , that &apos;s what . At least , that &apos;s what happened when Jane McGonigal tried to teach TED to play her favorite game . Then again , when the game is &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , &quot; what else would you expect ?
Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game : massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling .
It &apos;s the only game in the world that I know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
This is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute .
So this sounds pretty good , right ? Now you &apos;re willing to play .
In order to teach you this game , I &apos;m going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly , and we &apos;re going to do a little hands-on demo .
While they &apos;re coming up , I should let you know , this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists &apos; collective in Austria named Monochrom .
So thank you , Monochrom .
Okay , so most people are familiar with traditional , two-person thumb-wrestling .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
One , two , three , four , I declare a thumb war , and we wrestle , and of course Sunni beats me because she &apos;s the best .
Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , we &apos;re the gamer generation .
There are a billion gamers on the planet now , so we need more of a challenge .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
So we could get three thumbs together , and Peter could join us .
We could even have four thumbs together , and the way you win is you &apos;re the first person to pin someone else &apos;s thumb .
This is really important . You can &apos;t , like , wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute .
That is not how you win .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
So Eric would have won . He was the first person to pin my thumb .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first rule , and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node , but if you feel ambitious , you don &apos;t have to hold back .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
Now the only other rule you need to remember is , gamer generation , we like a challenge .
I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you &apos;re not using .
So I think we should kind of get some more involved .
And if we had just four people , we would do it just like this , and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time .
Perfect .
Now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
And in fact , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do right now .
We &apos;re going to try and get all , something like , I don &apos;t know , 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node .
And we have to connect both levels , so if you &apos;re up there , you &apos;re going to be reaching down and reaching up .
Now — — before we get started -- This is great . You &apos;re excited to play . — before we get started , can I have the slides back up here really quick , because if you get good at this game , I want you to know there are some advanced levels .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
This is the hardest level . This is the extreme .
So we &apos;ll stick with the normal one for now , and I &apos;m going to give you 30 seconds , every thumb into the node , connect the upper and the lower levels , you guys go on down there .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
If you have a free thumb , wave it around , make sure it gets connected .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
If you have a free thumb , wave it around to make sure .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Okay , on the count of three , you &apos;re going to go .
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Did you win ? You got it ? You got it ? Excellent !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game , let &apos;s do a quick recap on the positive emotions .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
You were like , &quot; What the hell is she talking about ? &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
Creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
How about surprise ? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We had excitement . As you started to wrestle , maybe you &apos;re starting to win or this person &apos;s , like , really into it , so you kind of get the excitement going .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
You &apos;ve been sitting for awhile , so the physical relief , getting to shake it out .
We had joy . You were laughing , smiling . Look at your faces . This room is full of joy .
We had some contentment .
I didn &apos;t see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing , so you were totally content to be playing .
The most important three emotions , awe and wonder , we had everybody connected physically for a minute .
When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And speaking of physical connection , you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin , you release oxytocin , you feel bonded to everyone in the room .
You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else &apos;s hand for at least six seconds .
You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds , so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other . That is great .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
You learned , from scratch , a game you never knew before .
Now you know how to play it . You can teach other people .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , this makes you a grandmaster of the game .
Because there aren &apos;t that many people who know how to play , we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
You guys , according to the rules , are legendary grandmasters , so congratulations .
I will just leave you with this tip , if you want to play again .
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster , you &apos;ve got your two nodes going on .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Everybody is thrown off . You go in for the kill .
That &apos;s how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling .
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
As his career grew , David Byrne went from playing CBGB to Carnegie Hall . He asks : Does the venue make the music ? From outdoor drumming to Wagnerian operas to arena rock , he explores how context has pushed musical innovation .
This is the venue where , as a young man , some of the music that I wrote was first performed .
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
This is a song that was recorded there .
This is not Talking Heads , in the picture anyway .
&quot; by Talking Heads ) So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And so the bands at Tootsie &apos;s or at CBGB &apos;s had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down , shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing .
Since then , I &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
I &apos;ve played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written , or was writing at the time , didn &apos;t sound all that great in some of those halls .
We managed , but sometimes those halls didn &apos;t seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made .
So I asked myself : Do I write stuff for specific rooms ?
Do I have a place , a venue , in mind when I write ?
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
Okay , Africa .
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa .
And the music there , I would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it &apos;s played , the setting , the context , it &apos;s all perfect . It all works perfect .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
There &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
And it would be a mess in a context like this . This is a gothic cathedral .
In a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
It doesn &apos;t change key , the notes are long , there &apos;s almost no rhythm whatsoever , and the room flatters the music .
It actually improves it .
This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for . This is the organ .
It &apos;s not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
He can , very innovatively , actually change keys without risking huge dissonances .
This is a little bit later .
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
They &apos;re smaller , even less reverberant , so he can write really frilly music that &apos;s very intricate -- and it works .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
It &apos;s around the same time , I think it was built around 1776 .
People in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
They used to eat , drink and yell out to people on the stage , just like they do at CBGB &apos;s and places like that .
If they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
And well , that was an opera experience .
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
He wanted a little more bombast , so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall &apos;s fair-sized .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
And they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than La Scala .
Around the same , according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
They had to be very quiet .
So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls .
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting .
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall , the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural .
This is Mahler .
It looks like Bob Dylan , but it &apos;s Mahler .
That was Bob &apos;s last record , yeah .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
According to Scott Joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
Again , it &apos;s noisy . They &apos;re playing for dancers .
There &apos;s certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
Well , there &apos;s only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers .
So the bands started to improvise new melodies .
And a new form of music was born .
These are played mainly in small rooms .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
Same thing goes true for -- that &apos;s the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it &apos;s rock or Latin music or whatever .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
And this was one way that the music got there .
Microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing .
So far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like Frank Sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone .
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
It &apos;s like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
So at this point , music diverged .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
Now there &apos;s venues like this , a discotheque , and there &apos;s jukeboxes in bars , where you don &apos;t even need to have a band .
There doesn &apos;t need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever , and the sound systems are good .
People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems .
And , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
And another new form of music was born .
Live performance , when it was incredibly successful , ended up in what is probably , acoustically , the worst sounding venues on the planet : sports stadiums , basketball arenas and hockey arenas .
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
They wrote what is now called arena rock , which is medium-speed ballads .
They did the best they could given that this is what they &apos;re writing for .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
It &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
And in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
So there &apos;s more new venues .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
I grew up with a radio in a car .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
The music that , I would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it .
It might not be what you want to listen to at home , but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum , you know , big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
There &apos;s one other kind of new venue , the private MP3 player .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
And in some ways it &apos;s like Carnegie Hall , or when the audience had to hush up , because you can now hear every single detail .
In other ways , it &apos;s more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
I think pop music , mainly , it &apos;s written today , to some extent , is written for these kind of players , for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail , but the dynamic doesn &apos;t change that much .
So I asked myself : Okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
And does it happen anywhere else ?
Well , according to David Attenborough and some other people , birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy , where the foliage is dense , their calls tend to be high-pitched , short and repetitive .
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
And birds like this Savannah sparrow , they tend to have a buzzing type call .
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
Other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call .
So birds do it too .
And I thought : Well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view .
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
And I &apos;m saying , well , the passion &apos;s still there , but the vessel that it &apos;s going to be injected into and poured into , that is instinctively and intuitively created first .
We already know where that passion is going .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
The writer , Thomas Frank , says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests , that voters , like a lot of us , assume , that if they hear something that sounds like it &apos;s sincere , that it &apos;s coming from the gut , that it &apos;s passionate , that it &apos;s more authentic .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
So that , if somebody can fake sincerity , if they can fake passion , they stand a better chance which seems a little dangerous .
I &apos;m saying the two , the passion , the joy , are not mutually exclusive .
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds .
We adapt .
We sing .
And like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Breel : Confessions of a depressed comic
Kevin Breel didn &apos;t look like a depressed kid : team captain , at every party , funny and confident . But he tells the story of the night he realized that -- to save his own life -- he needed to say four simple words .
For a long time in my life , I felt like I &apos;d been living two different lives .
There &apos;s the life that everyone sees , and then there &apos;s the life that only I see .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that &apos;s what they would tell you .
And that &apos;s a huge part of me . That is who I am .
And if you were to ask me to describe myself , I &apos;d probably say some of those same things .
And I wouldn &apos;t be lying , but I wouldn &apos;t totally be telling you the truth , either , because the truth is , that &apos;s just the life everyone else sees .
In the life that only I see , who I am , who I really am , is someone who struggles intensely with depression .
I have for the last six years of my life , and I continue to every day .
Now , for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn &apos;t really know what that means , that might surprise them to hear , because there &apos;s this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong , when you break up with your girlfriend , when you lose a loved one , when you don &apos;t get the job you wanted .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
Real depression isn &apos;t being sad when something in your life goes wrong .
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
That &apos;s real depression , and that &apos;s what I suffer from .
And to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
It &apos;s hard for me to talk about , and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about , so much so that no one &apos;s talking about it .
And no one &apos;s talking about depression , but we need to be , because right now it &apos;s a massive problem .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
We don &apos;t see it on Facebook . We don &apos;t see it on Twitter .
We don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
And so because we don &apos;t see it , we don &apos;t see the severity of it .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
And we have a tendency , as a society , to look at that and go , &quot; So what ? &quot;
So what ? We look at that , and we go , &quot; That &apos;s your problem .
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
We say we &apos;re sad and we say we &apos;re sorry , but we also say , &quot; So what ? &quot;
Well , two years ago it was my problem , because I sat on the edge of my bed where I &apos;d sat a million times before and I was suicidal .
I was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you wouldn &apos;t see a kid who was suicidal .
You &apos;d see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team , the drama and theater student of the year , the English student of the year , someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party .
So you would say I wasn &apos;t depressed , you would say I wasn &apos;t suicidal , but you would be wrong .
You would be wrong . So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it .
I came this close to doing it .
And I didn &apos;t , so that makes me one of the lucky ones , one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump , one of the lucky ones who survives .
Well , I survived , and that just leaves me with my story , and my story is this : In four simple words , I suffer from depression .
I suffer from depression , and for a long time , I think , I was living two totally different lives , where one person was always afraid of the other .
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was , that I wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought I was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
But for me , for a large part of my life , I feared myself .
I feared my truth , I feared my honesty , I feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner , like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so I thought about that way every single day .
I thought about it every single day , and if I &apos;m being totally honest , standing here I &apos;ve thought about it again since , because that &apos;s the sickness , that &apos;s the struggle , that &apos;s depression , and depression isn &apos;t chicken pox .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
It &apos;s something you live with . It &apos;s something you live in .
It &apos;s the roommate you can &apos;t kick out . It &apos;s the voice you can &apos;t ignore .
It &apos;s the feelings you can &apos;t seem to escape , the scariest part is that after a while , you become numb to it . It becomes normal for you , and what you really fear the most isn &apos;t the suffering inside of you .
It &apos;s the stigma inside of others , it &apos;s the shame , it &apos;s the embarrassment , it &apos;s the disapproving look on a friend &apos;s face , it &apos;s the whispers in the hallway that you &apos;re weak , it &apos;s the comments that you &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
It &apos;s the stigma . So you hold it in and you hide it , and you hold it in and you hide it , and even though it &apos;s keeping you in bed every day and it &apos;s making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it , you hide it , because the stigma in our society around depression is very real .
It &apos;s very real , and if you think that it isn &apos;t , ask yourself this : Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you &apos;re depressed ?
That &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
That &apos;s the stigma .
We are so , so , so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains . And that &apos;s ignorance .
That &apos;s pure ignorance , and that ignorance has created a world that doesn &apos;t understand depression , that doesn &apos;t understand mental health .
And that &apos;s ironic to me , because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world , yet it &apos;s one of the least discussed .
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it &apos;s not there and hope it &apos;ll fix itself .
Well , it won &apos;t . It hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one .
Well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
I wish I did , but I don &apos;t -- but I think , I think it has to start here .
It has to start with me , it has to start with you , it has to start with the people who are suffering , the ones who are hidden in the shadows .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in , because if there &apos;s one thing that I &apos;ve come to realize , if there &apos;s one thing that I see as the biggest problem , it &apos;s not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others .
It &apos;s in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves , where we &apos;re okay with who we are , because when we get honest , we see that we all struggle and we all suffer .
Whether it &apos;s with this , whether it &apos;s with something else , we all know what it is to hurt .
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart , and we all know how important it is to heal .
But right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
Well , it is there . It is there , and you know what ? It &apos;s okay .
Depression is okay . If you &apos;re going through it , know that you &apos;re okay .
And know that you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not weak , and it &apos;s an issue , not an identity , because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others , you can see depression for what it really is , and that &apos;s just a part of life , just a part of life , and as much as I hate , as much as I hate some of the places , some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to , in a lot of ways I &apos;m grateful for it .
Because yeah , it &apos;s put me in the valleys , but only to show me there &apos;s peaks , and yeah it &apos;s dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light .
My pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be .
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn &apos;t mean ignoring your dark .
The world I believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say , &quot; I &apos;m going through hell , &quot; and they can look back at me and go , &quot; Me too , &quot; and that &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay because depression is okay . We &apos;re people .
We &apos;re people , and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry , and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness , then I &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re wrong .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
So we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we &apos;re going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent , Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message : &quot; Iranians ... we &#91; heart &#93; you . &quot; Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and Iranians responded in kind . The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like &quot; Israel loves Iran , &quot; &quot; Iran loves Israel &quot; and even &quot; Palestine loves Israel . &quot;
On March 14 , this year , I posted this poster on Facebook .
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag .
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted .
A few days ago , I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store , and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other , and the owner was explaining to the client that we &apos;re going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel .
And the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
This is the context . This is where we are now in Israel .
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
It &apos;s like every year it &apos;s the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran .
It &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too late forever , for 10 years now .
So at some point it became , you know , to me , I &apos;m a graphic designer , so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before .
Most of the time , I make posters , I post them on Facebook , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day .
So I went to sleep , and that was it for me .
And later on in the night , I woke up because I &apos;m always waking up in the night , and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots , you know , on Facebook , which I &apos;ve never seen before .
And I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
So I come to the computer and I start looking on , and suddenly I see many people talking to me , most of them I don &apos;t know , and a few of them from Iran , which is -- What ?
Because you have to understand , in Israel we don &apos;t talk with people from Iran .
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
It &apos;s like , on Facebook , you have friends only from -- it &apos;s like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I start answering this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come , because they don &apos;t have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the poster , and they &apos;re all sitting in the living room crying .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
I ask my wife to come , and I tell her , you have to see that .
People are crying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
So I don &apos;t know what to do , so my first reflex , as a graphic designer , is , you know , to show everybody what I &apos;d just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that &apos;s how it started .
The day after , when really it became a lot of talking , I said to myself , and my wife said to me , I also want a poster , so this is her .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
But more seriously , I was like , okay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from Israel who want to say something .
So I &apos;m going to shoot all the people I know , if they want , and I &apos;m going to put them in a poster and I &apos;m going to share them .
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them , give me a picture , I will make you a poster .
And that &apos;s how it started . And that &apos;s how , really , it &apos;s unleashed , because suddenly people from Facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it .
It &apos;s not just one dude making one poster , it &apos;s -- we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , &quot; Make me a poster . Post it .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot;
It became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense .
I mean , so many pictures , so I asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because I didn &apos;t have the time .
It was a huge amount of pictures .
So for a few days , that &apos;s how my living room was .
And we received Israeli posters , Israeli images , but also lots of comments , lots of messages from Iran .
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because I know people : They don &apos;t read , they see images .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
This one is really moving for me because it &apos;s the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we &apos;re sending , she starts -- she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the Israeli flag , and she wished that we &apos;d meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after I posted the first poster .
The day after , Iranians started to respond with their own posters .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So you can see they are still shy , they don &apos;t want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
They want to respond . They want to say the same thing .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
It &apos;s a two-way story . It &apos;s Israelis and Iranians sending the same message , one to each other .
This never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we &apos;re on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say , &quot; I like this guy . I love those guys . &quot;
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Because when you &apos;re seeing the Middle East , you see only the bad news .
And suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . So the guys on the news , they say , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot;
I remember one day , Michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; Who &apos;s gonna see the show ? &quot; And he said , &quot; Everybody . &quot;
So she said , &quot; Everybody in Palestine , in where ? Israel ?
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
At some point , he just said , &quot; 40 million people are going to see you today .
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
Every time a country started talking about it , like Germany , America , wherever , a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories , so at the beginning we had &quot; Iran-Loves-Israel , &quot; which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran , saying , &quot; Okay , Israel loves Iran ?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
The moment I really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , &quot; Google the word &apos; Israel . &apos; &quot; And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing , &quot; Israel &quot; or &quot; Iran . &quot;
We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
You &apos;re somewhere over there , and then you want to see the Middle East , so you go on Google and you say , &quot; Israel , &quot; and they give you the bad stuff .
And for a few days you got those images .
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , I don &apos;t know , commented on one of the photos .
So for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , Michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
We &apos;re showing a new reality by just making images because that &apos;s how the world perceives us .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
So we &apos;re working on making good images . End of story .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
It &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
And at some point , you become friends on Facebook , and you become friends in life .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me , &quot; Okay , you &apos;re going to be in Europe , I &apos;m coming . I &apos;m coming from France , from Holland , from Germany , &quot; of course , and from Israel people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life .
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . And we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
At some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
And it goes the other way around .
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel , born and raised in Iran , lives in Germany , afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says , &quot; Okay , not that big a deal . &quot;
So a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called &quot; Not ready to die in your war . &quot;
I mean , it &apos;s plus / minus the same message , but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it .
And again , something amazing happened , something that we didn &apos;t have on the first wave of the campaign .
Now people from Iran , the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent , you know , their foot and half their faces , now they &apos;re sending their faces , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Okay , no problem , we &apos;re into it . We are with you . &quot;
Just read where those guys are from .
And for every guy from Israel , you &apos;ve got someone from Iran .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
So -- So you may ask yourself , who is this dude ?
My name is Ronny Edry , and I &apos;m 41 , I &apos;m an Israeli , I &apos;m a father of two , I &apos;m a husband , and I &apos;m a graphic designer . I &apos;m teaching graphic design .
And I &apos;m not that naive , because a lot of the time I &apos;ve been asked , many times I &apos;ve been asked , &quot; Yeah , but , this is really naive , sending flowers over , I mean — &quot; I was in the army . I was in the paratroopers for three years , and I know how it looks from the ground .
I know how it can look really bad .
So to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
And sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .
Maybe as people , because especially in Israel , we &apos;re in a democracy . We have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
So I want to ask Michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it &apos;s all about images .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
And I &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and I &apos;m just going to post it on Facebook with kind of &quot; Israelis for peace &quot; or something .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Capt. Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation first discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- an endless floating waste of plastic trash . Now he &apos;s drawing attention to the growing , choking problem of plastic debris in our seas .
Let &apos;s talk trash .
You know , we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II .
After the war , we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime .
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes .
Mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .
Half of each year &apos;s 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .
A large , unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea .
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport .
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
In spite of deposit fees , much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes , here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California .
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja &apos;s sparsely populated central coast .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate , PET , will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .
Also , the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic , polypropylene .
They will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
Let &apos;s trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo .
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific , while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas .
After ten years , a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch , while ours litter the Philippines .
After 20 years , we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre .
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks .
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach .
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
but , mostly bottle caps .
Sadly , their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .
This is Mae West , still alive at a zookeeper &apos;s home in New Orleans .
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem , so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula , at the east end of our long beach .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro .
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display .
In spite of my &quot; girly man &quot; hat , crocheted from plastic shopping bags , they shook my hand .
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
Here &apos;s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this .
And this .
Now , when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this .
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach , the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington .
Now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills .
We did hundreds of necropsies , and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .
The record-holder , only two-and-a-half inches long , had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
Now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can &apos;t fix the natural system in the ocean we &apos;ve broken .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
Narrator : The levels are increasing , the amount of packaging is increasing , the &quot; throwaway &quot; concept of living is proliferating , and it &apos;s showing up in the ocean .
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process .
The solution , Moore says , is to stop the plastic at its source : stop it on land before it falls in the ocean .
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline , in Long Beach , California .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
Every day , in a city the size of London , 30 million meals are served . But where does all the food come from ? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city , and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world .
How do you feed a city ?
It &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant , or indeed into this theater &apos;s foyer in about an hour &apos;s time , there is going to be food there waiting for us , having magically come from somewhere .
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London , enough food has to be produced , transported , bought and sold , cooked , eaten , disposed of , and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth , it &apos;s remarkable that cities get fed at all .
We live in places like this as if they &apos;re the most natural things in the world , forgetting that because we &apos;re animals and that we need to eat , we &apos;re actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were .
And as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us .
These are extraordinary landscapes , but few of us ever get to see them .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
As more of us move into cities , more of us are eating meat , so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals .
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it &apos;s passed through an animal first , that &apos;s not a very efficient way of feeding us .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
By 2050 , it &apos;s estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities .
And it &apos;s also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
That &apos;s a big problem . And actually if we carry on as we are , it &apos;s a problem we &apos;re very unlikely to be able to solve .
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .
Although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West .
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away .
And to end all of this , at the end of this long process , we &apos;re not even managing to feed the planet properly .
A billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve .
None of it makes very much sense .
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations , it &apos;s a grim picture .
As we &apos;re moving into cities , the world is also embracing a Western diet .
And if we look to the future , it &apos;s an unsustainable diet .
So how did we get here ?
And more importantly , what are we going to do about it ?
Well , to answer the slightly easier question first , about 10,000 years ago , I would say , is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East , known as the Fertile Crescent .
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
And it was also fertile .
And it was here , about 10,000 years ago , that two extraordinary inventions , agriculture and urbanism , happened roughly in the same place and at the same time .
This is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . They need each other .
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements .
And if we look at what those settlements were like , we see they were compact .
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers .
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn &apos;t eat back to the people .
So , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
Famously , Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself ?
The answer is what I call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
Basically , Rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world , because it was very difficult to transport food over roads , which were rough .
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves .
And , in fact , you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long , drawn out militarized shopping spree , really .
In fact -- I love the fact , I just have to mention this : Rome in fact used to import oysters from London , at one stage . I think that &apos;s extraordinary .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century , we can see that its grain , which is coming in from the Thames , along the bottom of this map .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside , which was the main market , were also grain markets .
And if you look at the name of one of those streets , Bread Street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . Same thing .
And of course Billingsgate , famously , was London &apos;s fish market , operating on-site here until the mid-1980s .
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it .
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .
This is another thing about food in cities : Once its roots into the city are established , they very rarely move .
Meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
So much of London &apos;s meat was coming from the northwest , from Scotland and Wales .
So it was coming in , and arriving at the city at the northwest , which is why Smithfield , London &apos;s very famous meat market , was located up there .
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on , to the northeast .
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . Anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called Poultry .
And , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food , both by reading the names of the streets , which give you a lot of clues .
Friday Street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday .
But also you have to imagine it full of food .
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .
In fact , if you were having Sunday lunch , the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier .
So this was obviously an organic city , part of an organic cycle .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep .
So all of a sudden , these animals are no longer walking into market .
They &apos;re being slaughtered out of sight and mind , somewhere in the countryside .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
To start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place .
Cities used to be constrained by geography ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
And as you can see from these maps of London , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people .
And of course that was just the beginning . After the trains came cars , and really this marks the end of this process .
It &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
And this is the kind of city that &apos;s devoid of smell , devoid of mess , certainly devoid of people , because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape .
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
And this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
Here we have food -- that used to be the center , the social core of the city -- at the periphery .
It used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you &apos;re making a cake or something .
We don &apos;t smell food to see if it &apos;s okay to eat .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
And we don &apos;t value food . We don &apos;t trust it .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they &apos;ve actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
And also they &apos;ve made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we &apos;ve seen , are unsustainable .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
500 years ago it &apos;s what Thomas More was asking himself .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states , if that sounds remotely familiar , a day &apos;s walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad , and grew vegetables in their back gardens , and ate communal meals together , and so on .
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia , even though More never framed it that way .
And here is another very famous &quot; Utopian &quot; vision , that of Ebenezer Howard , &quot; The Garden City . &quot;
Same idea : series of semi-independent city-states , little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around , joined to one another by railway .
the ordering principle of his vision .
It even got built , but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had .
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas , that they are Utopian .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
It was a kind of joke , because it &apos;s got a double derivation from the Greek .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
Because it &apos;s an ideal . It &apos;s an imaginary thing . We can &apos;t have it .
And I think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use .
So I &apos;ve come up with an alternative , which is Sitopia , from the ancient Greek , &quot; sitos &quot; for food , and &quot; topos &quot; for place .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
We live in a world shaped by food , and if we realize that , we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool , design tool , to shape the world differently .
So if we were to do that , what might Sitopia look like ?
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
I have to use this slide . It &apos;s just the look on the face of the dog .
But anyway , this is -- it &apos;s food at the center of life , at the center of family life , being celebrated , being enjoyed , people taking time for it .
This is where food should be in our society .
But you can &apos;t have scenes like this unless you have people like this .
By the way , these can be men as well .
It &apos;s people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
Because without these kinds of people we can &apos;t have places like this .
Here , I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Because without that , you can &apos;t have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto .
It &apos;s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .
Here is a plant called Kevin , or maybe it &apos;s a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin . I don &apos;t know .
But anyway , these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important .
So Sitopia , for me , is really a way of seeing .
It &apos;s basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere .
The trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing .
And if we do that , we &apos;re going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this .
We &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
But of course , that &apos;s not a great image either , because we need not to be producing food like this anymore .
We need to be thinking more about permaculture , which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago .
It &apos;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti &apos;s &quot; Allegory of Good Government . &quot;
It &apos;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
If the city looks after the country , the country will look after the city .
And I want us to ask now , what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
What would an allegory of good government look like today ?
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
It &apos;s one we have to ask , and we have to start answering .
We know we are what we eat .
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
But if we take that idea , we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
Singer / songwriter Eddi Reader performs &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill , &quot; a tender look back at a lost love . With Thomas Dolby on piano .
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill where I used to go and spend hours going &quot; When is he coming back ? When is he coming back ? &quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I &apos;ve got over .
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
It &apos;s a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan , actually , for me .
Boo Hewerdine , Thomas Dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . It &apos;s been a blessing singing for you .
Thank you very much .
Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Those summer nights , so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you think of me sometimes up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Oh , I pray you one day will We won &apos;t say a word We won &apos;t need them Sometimes silence is best We &apos;ll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Do you think of me sometimes ? And do you ever make that climb ? Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you ever make that climb up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Kiteflyer &apos;s ... &#91; French &#93; Where are you ? Where are you now ? Where are you now ? Kiteflyer &apos;s ... Gracias . Thank you very much .
Christopher C. Deam : The Airstream , restyled
In this low-key , image-packed talk from 2002 , designer Christopher C. Deam talks about his makeover of an American classic : the Airstream travel trailer .
a plastic laminate company , which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York , in 2000 .
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley , I &apos;d actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer , or any other trailer .
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream .
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight , modern , futuristic , high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway , and the interiors were completely out of sync with that .
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
That seemed really like a crisis to me , that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape , and about travel , and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell .
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what &apos;s authentic in an Airstream trailer , and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell .
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
The main goal was to smooth out the interior , and begin to speak about motion , and mobility , and independence .
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
There &apos;s no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together , where you can change materials and shapes .
So that became a challenge .
Compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that I was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space , so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way , and that the casework wouldn &apos;t break up the space .
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
That trailer led to another commission , to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block .
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo , in October .
Teruo Kurosaki , who owns a furniture company called Idee , he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo .
He said one he would like to make a real trailer , functioning , and we would sell that one .
Trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want .
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States , that would collect records and go on tours .
This trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system .
It &apos;s got a huge couch , fits quite a few people , and basically we &apos;d had a great time with this .
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream .
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream .
They came to me and said , &quot; Well , what can we do to freshen this thing up ?
And do you think kids , you know , skateboarders , surfers , rock climbers , would use these things ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , not in that interior . &quot;
Anyway , I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it &apos;s called the Bambi prototype .
I thought , &quot; Finally , oh yeah great , big company , I &apos;m gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding . &quot;
And I walked in their prototype facility , and it &apos;s exactly like my shop , only bigger -- same tools , same things .
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there &apos;s no money for tooling or molding .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
All the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
We think of pain as a symptom , but there are cases where the nervous system develops feedback loops and pain becomes a terrifying disease in itself . Starting with the story of a girl whose sprained wrist turned into a nightmare , Elliot Krane talks about the complex mystery of chronic pain , and reviews the facts we &apos;re just learning about how it works and how to treat it .
I &apos;m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so I put children to sleep for a living .
And I &apos;m an academic , so I put audiences to sleep for free .
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children &apos;s Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto .
And it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
Now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease , and that &apos;s true most of the time .
It &apos;s the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
But about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
It persists for months and oftentimes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , I want to show you how it feels for my patients .
So imagine , if you will , that I &apos;m stroking your arm with this feather , as I &apos;m stroking my arm right now .
Now , I want you to imagine that I &apos;m stroking it with this .
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
Imagine I were to stroke your child &apos;s arm with this feather , and their brain &#91; was &#93; telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
That was the experience of my patient , Chandler , whom you see in the photograph .
As you can see , she &apos;s a beautiful , young woman .
She was 16 years old last year when I met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer .
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals , she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist .
Now you would probably imagine , as she did , that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person &apos;s life .
Wrap it in an ACE bandage , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that &apos;s the end of the story .
But in Chandler &apos;s case , that was the beginning of the story .
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain .
You can see that the arm is discolored , purplish in color .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
The muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that .
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands , to her fingertips , from her wrist up to her elbow , almost all the way to her shoulder .
But the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
The worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame ?
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
In your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
And when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
And when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
If you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm -- that , of course , we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
But the situation , of course , in the human body is far more complicated than that .
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion , in fact , what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally , vertically , up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells .
These cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation , amplification and , in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences .
These glial cells become activated .
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins , which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves , and they start releasing their neurotransmitters , and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells , and so on and so forth , until what we have is a positive feedback loop .
It &apos;s almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
That &apos;s crazy , but that &apos;s , in fact , what happens with chronic pain .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time .
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics .
And most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
It &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of Chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she &apos;s a college student studying dance at Long Beach here , and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
But the future is actually even brighter .
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain .
So I have hope that in the future , the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized , who said , &quot; My philosophy : No pain , no pain . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Polio is almost completely eradicated . But as Bruce Aylward says : Almost isn &apos;t good enough with a disease this terrifying . Aylward lays out the plan to continue the scientific miracle that ended polio in most of the world -- and to snuff it out everywhere , forever .
I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea .
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
But to get us started , I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world .
Now I bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that I haven &apos;t even heard of , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure , pretty sure , that absolutely nobody is thinking of this .
This is a polio vaccine .
And it &apos;s a great thing actually that nobody &apos;s had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
Even here in California , if we were to go back just a few years , it was a very different story .
People were terrified of this disease .
They were terrified of polio , and it would cause public panic .
And it was because of scenes like this .
In this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before , and then two days later , they can no longer breathe , and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs , but also their breathing muscles .
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives , usually , in this iron lung to breathe for them .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
Twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
Finally , a vaccine that could stop this awful disease , and here in the United States it had an incredible impact .
As you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
And it happened so fast in the United States , however , that even just last month Jon Stewart said this : Jon Stewart : Where is polio still active ?
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated .
Bruce Aylward : Oops . Jon , polio &apos;s almost been eradicated .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
But the reason there &apos;s not very much left is because there &apos;s been an extraordinary public / private partnership working behind the scenes , almost unknown , I &apos;m sure to most of you here today .
It &apos;s been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease , and it &apos;s got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic .
But just last year , we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn &apos;t good enough with a virus like polio .
And this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
And in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
And not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years .
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you , these are under control now , and it looks like they &apos;ll probably stop very , very quickly .
But the message was very clear .
Polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
It &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis .
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership , the Polio Partnership , is trying to do .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
We &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don &apos;t snuff it out completely .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
We want a world in which every child , just like you guys , can take for granted a polio-free world .
So we &apos;re looking for a permanent solution , and this is where we get lucky .
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary .
This virus can only survive in people .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
And we &apos;ve got pretty good vaccines , as I &apos;ve just showed you .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth .
Now we don &apos;t have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
It &apos;s been tried six times in the last century , and it &apos;s been successful exactly once .
And this is because disease eradication , it &apos;s still the venture capital of public health .
The risks are massive , but the pay-off -- economic , humanitarian , motivational -- it &apos;s absolutely huge .
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs .
And if we can finish polio eradication , the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
But smallpox eradication was hard ; it was very , very hard .
And polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
The first is that , when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago , more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox .
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
So it was a massive effort .
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine , which was very stable , and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile .
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we &apos;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not potent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge -- is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash .
So you could get around the disease ; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
So you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and as a result , we &apos;ve needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox .
We &apos;ve had to create one of the largest social movements in history .
There &apos;s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime .
These people , these 20 million people , vaccinate over 500 million children every single year , multiple times at the peak of our operation .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher .
And these vaccinators , these volunteers , they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest , densest urban slums in the world .
They &apos;ve got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote , difficult to reach places in the world .
And they also have to dodge bullets , because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children , even in areas affected by conflict .
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio , not once , but twice , because they got reinfected .
He was sitting outside of the road , watching one of these polio campaigns unfold , and a few months later he wrote : &quot; This is foreign aid at its most heroic . &quot;
And these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were striking .
Within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
And in each of those , it was only part of the country .
And then , by 1999 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept .
And then today , there &apos;s been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease .
When we started , over 20 years ago , 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
And at the same time , the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas .
It &apos;s been working to help control pandemic flu , SARS for example .
It &apos;s also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops , giving measles shots , giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns .
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict .
So things were looking very exciting , and then about five years ago , this virus , this ancient virus , started to fight back .
The first problem we ran into was that , in these last four countries , the strongholds of this virus , we just couldn &apos;t seem to get the virus rooted out .
And then to make the matters even worse , the virus started to spread out of these four places , especially northern India and northern Nigeria , into much of Africa , Asia , and even into Europe , causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades .
And then , in one of the most important , tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world , we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have .
In conditions like this , the vaccine just couldn &apos;t get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to .
Now at that time , there was a great , as you can imagine , frustration -- let &apos;s call it frustration -- it started to grow very , very quickly .
And all of a sudden , some very important voices in the world of public health started to say , &quot; Hang on .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds , it &apos;s a false premise .
The brutal truth is , if we don &apos;t have the will or the skill , or even the money that we need to reach children , the most vulnerable children in the world , with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine , then pretty soon , more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year .
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern Nigeria .
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
This leg , his right leg , now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl , because it &apos;s faster to move that way to keep up with his friends , keep up with his brothers and sisters , than to get up on his crutches and walk .
But Umar is a fantastic student . He &apos;s an incredible kid .
As you probably can &apos;t see the detail here , but this is his report card , and you &apos;ll see , he &apos;s got perfect scores .
He got 100 percent in all the important things , like nursery rhymes , for example there .
But you know I &apos;d love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days , but it &apos;s not true .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
It leaves their children paralyzed , and it drags their families deeper into poverty , because they &apos;re desperately searching and they &apos;re desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have , trying in vain to find a cure for their children .
We think children deserve better .
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago , when people were saying , &quot; We should call it off , &quot; the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions , new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again .
In northern India , we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this , so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters , so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services .
In northern Nigeria , the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders , they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence .
And now they &apos;ve even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices , little GIS trackers like this , which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators .
And then they can track them , and at the end of the day , they look and see , did these guys get every single street , every single house .
This is the kind of commitment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
And in Afghanistan , we &apos;re trying new approaches -- access negotiators .
We &apos;re working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
But as we tried these extraordinary things , as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics , we went back to the vaccine -- it &apos;s a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought , surely we can make a better vaccine , so that when they finally get to these kids , we can have a better bang for our buck .
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
Now June the ninth , 2009 , we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine , and it turned out to be a game-changer .
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this .
Well , in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan , because it &apos;s in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this .
Now here at TED , over the last couple of days , I &apos;ve seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible .
So this morning at about seven o &apos;clock , I decided that we &apos;d try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again , so that you could see something that &apos;s just unfolding today , which proves that the impossible is possible .
And only two years ago , people were saying that this is impossible .
Now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio .
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month .
Sanitation is terrible , and our old vaccine , you remember , worked half as well as it should have .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history , not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar .
India &apos;s not unique .
In Umar &apos;s home country of Nigeria , a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year .
And in the last six months , we &apos;ve had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history .
Ladies and gentlemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere .
We have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s doable , it has great secondary benefits , and polio eradication is a great buy .
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus , it &apos;s a stark reminder that we are failing , as a society , to reach children with the most basic of services .
And for that reason , polio eradication : it &apos;s the ultimate in equity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justice .
The huge social movement that &apos;s been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children .
It &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm , capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago .
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do , and it &apos;s the right thing to do .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio , &quot; There &apos;s never a wrong time to do the right thing . &quot;
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do .
And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years .
We have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics .
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .
But if we blink now , we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease .
Here &apos;s a great idea to spread : End polio now .
Help us tell the story .
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child , every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Well Bruce , where do you think the toughest places are going to be ?
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
B The four places where you saw , that we &apos;ve never stopped -- northern Nigeria , northern India , the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they &apos;re going to be the toughest .
But the interesting thing is , of those three , India &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
And Afghanistan , Afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
It keeps getting reinfected .
So the tough ones : going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year .
And is it easy to raise that money ?
And what &apos;s it going to be like the next couple of years ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year .
That &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
It sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money .
But when you &apos;re reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20 , 30 cents to reach a child -- that &apos;s not very much money .
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
We have a big gap in that money . We &apos;re cutting corners , and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slows us down .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
Well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
&quot; Secrets can take many forms -- they can be shocking , or silly , or soulful . &quot; Frank Warren , the founder of PostSecret.com , shares some of the half-million secrets that strangers have mailed him on postcards .
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
They were blank on one side , and on the other side I listed some simple instructions .
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox , not just with postmarks from Washington , D.C. , but from Texas , California , Vancouver , New Zealand , Iraq .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
What I &apos;d like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
&quot; I found these stamps as a child , and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard .
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now .
&quot; Everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes I &apos;m dead . &quot;
&quot; I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes I didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot;
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you .
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
And sometimes afterwards I &apos;ll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
And I should also mention that , just like today , at that PostSecret event , I was using a wireless microphone .
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
This was really embarrassing when it happened , until I realized it could have been worse .
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
&quot; Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn &apos;t use .
I feel like the happiest person on Earth &quot; &quot; One of these men is the father of my son .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
&quot; That Saturday when you wondered where I was , well , I was getting your ring .
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine &apos;s Day .
It was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
And it hadn &apos;t been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
And he said , &quot; Frank , I &apos;ve got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
He said , &quot; For three years , my girlfriend and I , we &apos;ve made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
I read some to her , she reads some to me . &quot;
He says , &quot; It &apos;s really brought us closer together through the years .
And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom , I was beside myself .
And I tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
And just like every Sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . &quot;
He said , &quot; But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he said , &quot; She read it once and then she read it again . &quot;
And she turned to him and said , &quot; Is that our cat ? &quot;
And when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
He popped the question , she said yes . It was a very happy ending .
So I emailed him back and I said , &quot; Please share with me an image , something , that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . &quot;
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
I finally got the pictures developed and I &apos;d love to give them to you . &quot;
This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it , but this secret has impacted many lives , starting with a student up in Canada named Matty .
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called IFoundYourCamera .
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they &apos;ve found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
And it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people &apos;s lives can be huge .
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans , sometimes going through language barriers .
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today .
&quot; When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . &quot;
When I posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet again .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
It &apos;s somebody &apos;s birthday today Somebody &apos;s birthday today The candles are lighted on somebody &apos;s cake And we &apos;re all invited for somebody &apos;s sake You &apos;re 21 years old today .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because I was struggling with my own secrets .
And it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book ?
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
At TEDWomen , Tony Porter makes a call to men everywhere : Don &apos;t &quot; act like a man . &quot; Telling powerful stories from his own life , he shows how this mentality , drummed into so many men and boys , can lead men to disrespect , mistreat and abuse women and each other . His solution : Break free of the &quot; man box . &quot;
I grew up in New York City , between Harlem and the Bronx .
Growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating -- no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects .
I &apos;ve later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men , better known as the &quot; man box . &quot;
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man .
Now I also want to say , without a doubt , there are some wonderful , wonderful , absolutely wonderful things about being a man .
But at the same time , there &apos;s some stuff that &apos;s just straight up twisted , and we really need to begin to challenge , look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing , redefining , what we come to know as manhood .
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : Kendall and Jay .
And when they were about five and six , four and five , Jay could come to me , come to me crying .
It didn &apos;t matter what she was crying about , she could get on my knee , she could snot my sleeve up , just cry , cry it out .
Daddy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said , he &apos;s only 15 months older than her -- he &apos;d come to me crying , it &apos;s like as soon as I would hear him cry , a clock would go off .
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds , which means , by the time he got to me , I was already saying things like , &quot; Why are you crying ?
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box , I would find myself saying things like , &quot; Just go in your room .
Just go on , go on in your room .
Sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
And as I grow in life , I would say to myself , &quot; My God , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot;
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family .
My brother , Henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
We lived in the Bronx at the time , and the burial was in a place called Long Island , it was about two hours outside of the city .
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial , the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city .
And the limousine empties out .
My mother , my sister , my auntie , they all get out , but my father and I stayed in the limousine , and no sooner than the women got out , he burst out crying .
He didn &apos;t want cry in front of me , but he knew he wasn &apos;t going to make it back to the city , and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women .
And this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can &apos;t even imagine .
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying .
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box .
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy , a football player , and I asked him , I said , &quot; How would you feel if , in front of all the players , your coach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot;
Now I expected him to say something like , I &apos;d be sad ; I &apos;d be mad ; I &apos;d be angry , or something like that .
No , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; It would destroy me . &quot;
And I said to myself , &quot; God , if it would destroy him to be called a girl , what are we then teaching him about girls ? &quot;
It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
At this time we &apos;re living in the Bronx , and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny .
He was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys .
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
And this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder , &quot; What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys ? &quot;
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
He was a troubled kid .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
But I &apos;ve got to tell you , we young guys , we looked up to this dude , man .
He was cool . He was fine .
That &apos;s what the sisters said , &quot; He was fine . &quot;
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
So one day , I &apos;m out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around , doing something -- I don &apos;t know what .
He looks out his window ; he calls me upstairs ; he said , &quot; Hey Anthony . &quot;
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
As he opens the door , he says to me , &quot; Do you want some ? &quot;
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
Because for me growing up at that time , and our relationship with this man box , &quot; Do you want some ? &quot; meant one of two things : sex or drugs -- and we weren &apos;t doing drugs .
Now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy .
Two things : One , I never had sex .
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
You only tell your dearest , closest friend , sworn to secrecy for life , the first time you had sex .
For everybody else , we go around like we &apos;ve been having sex since we were two .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
The other thing I couldn &apos;t tell him is that I didn &apos;t want any .
That &apos;s even worse . We &apos;re supposed to always be on the prowl .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
Anyway , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that .
So , like my mother would say , make a long story short , I just simply said to Johnny , &quot; Yes . &quot;
He told me to go in his room .
I go in his room . On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
She &apos;s what I know today to be mentally ill , higher-functioning at times than others .
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
Well actually , he raped her , but he would say he had sex with her .
Because , while Sheila never said no , she also never said yes .
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
So when I go in the room , I close the door .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can &apos;t bust in the room and see that I &apos;m not doing anything , and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something .
So now I &apos;m no longer trying to figure out what I &apos;m going to do ; I &apos;m trying to figure out how I &apos;m going to get out of this room .
So in my 12 years of wisdom , I zip my pants down , I walk out into the room , and lo and behold to me , while I was in the room with Sheila , Johnny was back at the window calling guys up .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
And they asked me how was it , and I say to them , &quot; It was good , &quot; and I zip my pants up in front of them , and I head for the door .
Now I say this all with remorse , and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time , but I was conflicted , because , while I was feeling remorse , I was excited , because I didn &apos;t get caught .
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
This fear , getting outside the man box , totally enveloped me .
It was way more important to me , about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her .
See collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men .
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
We as men , good men , the large majority of men , we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization .
We kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
You see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it .
So we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
The center for disease control says that men &apos;s violence against women is at epidemic proportions , is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad .
So quickly , I &apos;d like to just say , this is the love of my life , my daughter Jay .
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving ?
I need you on board . I need you with me .
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it &apos;s okay to not be dominating , that it &apos;s okay to have feelings and emotions , that it &apos;s okay to promote equality , that it &apos;s okay to have women who are just friends and that &apos;s it , that it &apos;s okay to be whole , that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy , I asked a nine-year-old boy , &quot; What would life be like for you , if you didn &apos;t have to adhere to this man box ? &quot;
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
Four-star general Stanley McChrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military . How can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets ? By listening and learning -- and addressing the possibility of failure .
Ten years ago , on a Tuesday morning , I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
It was a routine training jump , like many more I &apos;d done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before .
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early .
You do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
And you &apos;re very careful how you put the straps , particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs .
And then you put on your reserve , and then you put on your heavy rucksack .
And then a jumpmaster comes , and he &apos;s an experienced NCO in parachute operations .
He checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he &apos;s tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
Then you sit down , and you wait a little while , because this is the Army .
Then you load the aircraft , and then you stand up and you get on , and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this , in a line of people , and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft .
And you wait a little bit longer , because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait .
Then you take off .
And it &apos;s painful enough now -- and I think it &apos;s designed this way -- it &apos;s painful enough so you want to jump .
You didn &apos;t really want to jump , but you want out .
So you get in the aircraft , you &apos;re flying along , and at 20 minutes out , these jumpmasters start giving you commands .
They give 20 minutes -- that &apos;s a time warning .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
And of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
And that &apos;s to boost everybody &apos;s confidence , to show that you &apos;re not scared .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
If you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
And then you hook up , and you hook up your static line .
And at that point , you think , &quot; Hey , guess what ?
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
There &apos;s no way to get out of this at this point . &quot;
You go through some additional checks , and then they open the door .
And this was that Tuesday morning in September , and it was pretty nice outside .
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
And then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; Go . &quot;
The first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
You fall outside the door , you &apos;re caught in the slipstream .
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest , your arms extended , put over your reserve parachute .
You do that because , 27 years before , an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .
I have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and I wasn &apos;t going to test the hypothesis that he &apos;d be wrong .
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open .
If you don &apos;t get an opening shock , you don &apos;t get a parachute -- you &apos;ve got a whole new problem set .
But typically you do ; typically it opens .
And of course , if your leg straps aren &apos;t set right , at that point you get another little thrill .
Boom .
So then you look around , you &apos;re under a canopy and you say , &quot; This is good . &quot;
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
And you really can &apos;t decide where you hit very much , because they pretend you can steer , but you &apos;re being delivered .
So you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
And then as you get close , you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line , so that it &apos;s not on you when you land , and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall .
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
In 30-some years of jumping , I never did one .
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window .
And as soon as I hit , the first thing I did is I &apos;d see if I &apos;d broken anything that I needed .
I &apos;d shake my head , and I &apos;d ask myself the eternal question : &quot; Why didn &apos;t I go into banking ? &quot;
And I &apos;d look around , and then I &apos;d see another paratrooper , a young guy or girl , and they &apos;d have pulled out their M4 carbine and they &apos;d be picking up their equipment .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
And I realized that , if they had to go into combat , they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .
And I realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well .
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did .
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump , but it &apos;s not any jump -- that was September 11th , 2001 .
And when we took off from the airfield , America was at peace .
When we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very , very real -- and leadership seemed important .
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general .
I &apos;d been successful , but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes , and on that morning , I didn &apos;t know it .
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership : Robert E. Lee , John Buford at Gettysburg .
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ; they didn &apos;t lie , cheat , steal or abandon their comrades .
And I still believe real leaders are like that .
But in my first 25 years of career , I had a bunch of different experiences .
One of my first battalion commanders , I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds .
And I &apos;m not sure that was real interaction .
But then a couple of years later , when I was a company commander , I went out to the National Training Center .
And we did an operation , and my company did a dawn attack -- you know , the classic dawn attack : you prepare all night , move to the line of departure .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
We move forward , and we get wiped out -- I mean , wiped out immediately .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
And after the battle , they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot; after action review &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
They put a big screen up , and they take you through everything : &quot; and then you didn &apos;t do this , and you didn &apos;t do this , etc . &quot;
I walked out feeling as low as a snake &apos;s belly in a wagon rut .
And I saw my battalion commander , because I had let him down .
And I went up to apologize to him , and he said , &quot; Stanley , I thought you did great . &quot;
And in one sentence , he lifted me , put me back on my feet , and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure .
When 9 / 11 came , 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world .
First , the things that are obvious , that you &apos;re familiar with : the environment changed -- the speed , the scrutiny , the sensitivity of everything now is so fast , sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it .
But everything we do is in a different context .
More importantly , the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries .
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them , I &apos;m now leading a force that &apos;s dispersed , and I &apos;ve got to use other techniques .
I &apos;ve got to use video teleconferences , I &apos;ve got to use chat , I &apos;ve got to use everything I can , not just for communication , but for leadership .
A 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations .
An emerging opportunity came -- didn &apos;t have time to get everybody together .
So we had to get complex intelligence together , we had to line up the ability to act .
It was sensitive , we had to go up the chain of command , convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence -- me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
In reality , much of the force I led looked exactly like you .
It was men , women , young , old -- not just from military ; from different organizations , many of them detailed to us just from a handshake .
And so instead of giving orders , you &apos;re now building consensus and you &apos;re building a sense of shared purpose .
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan , and on that operation , a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team .
We talked about the operation , and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that .
I asked , &quot; Where were you on 9 / 11 ? &quot;
And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair &apos;s tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said , &quot; Sir , I was in the sixth grade . &quot;
And it reminded me that we &apos;re operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness , and yet he has different experiences , in many cases a different vocabulary , a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise , because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot , that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn &apos;t what the force was doing anymore .
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven &apos;t done what the people you &apos;re leading are doing ?
And it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent , a lot more willing to listen , a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower .
And yet , again , you &apos;re not all in one room .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
You don &apos;t reset , or recharge your battery every time .
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces .
And I remembered his son was in our force .
And I said , &quot; John , where &apos;s your son ? And how is he ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Sir , he &apos;s fine . Thanks for asking . &quot;
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
And he pointed at the screen , he said , &quot; He &apos;s in that firefight . &quot;
Think about watching your brother , father , daughter , son , wife in a firefight in real time and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
Think about knowing that over time .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
I probably learned the most about relationships .
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment .
And every morning in the Ranger regiment , every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed .
You may know one line of it , it says , &quot; I &apos;ll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy . &quot;
And it &apos;s not a mindless mantra , and it &apos;s not a poem .
It &apos;s a promise .
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger , &quot; No matter what happens , no matter what it costs me , if you need me , I &apos;m coming . &quot;
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger .
Think about it . It &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And they &apos;ve lived up to it , which gives it special power .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007 , and an old friend of mine , that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note , just in an envelope , that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said , &quot; I knew if I ever got in a tight spot , that you would come , if alive . &quot;
And having that kind of relationship , for me , turned out to be critical at many points in my career .
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment , because it &apos;s tough .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
I came to believe that a leader isn &apos;t good because they &apos;re right ; they &apos;re good because they &apos;re willing to learn and to trust .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
It &apos;s not like that electronic abs machine where , 15 minutes a month , you get washboard abs .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
You can get knocked down , and it hurts and it leaves scars .
But if you &apos;re a leader , the people you &apos;ve counted on will help you up .
And if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
Thank you .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
When he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly &quot; supplies , &quot; Arunachalam Muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad . His research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model .
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
It makes me to stand here , the fame , the money I got out of it .
So what I did , I &apos;d gone back to my early marriage days .
What you did in the early marriage days , you tried to impress your wife . I did the same .
On that occasion , I found my wife carrying something like this .
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
Then , being her husband , I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth .
I don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days .
Then I immediately asked her , why are you &#91; using &#93; that unhygienic method ?
She replied , I also know about &#91; sanitary pads &#93; , but myself and my sisters , if they start using that , we have to cut our family milk budget .
Then I was shocked . What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget ?
And it &apos;s called affordability .
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads .
I went to a local shop , I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet .
That fellow looks left and right , and spreads a newspaper , rolls it into the newspaper , gives it to me like a banned item , something like that .
I don &apos;t know why . I did not ask for a condom .
Then I took that pad . I want to see that . What is inside it ?
The very first time , at the age of 29 , that day I am touching the sanitary pad , first ever .
I must know : How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad ?
They are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
Then I thought to myself , white substance , made of cotton -- oh my God , that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds , dollars .
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
That &apos;s how all this started , but after making a sanitary pad , where can I check it ?
It &apos;s not like I can just check it in the lab .
I need a woman volunteer . Where can I get one in India ?
Even in Bangalore you won &apos;t get &#91; one &#93; , in India .
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife .
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife &apos;s name is Shanti .
&quot; Close your eyes . Whatever I give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
Because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
So one day she said , openly , I &apos;m not going to support this research .
Then other victims , they got into my sisters .
But even sisters , wives , they &apos;re not ready to support in the research .
That &apos;s why I am always jealous with the saints in India .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
You know , without them even calling , they &apos;ll get a lot of women volunteers .
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
They also refused . Finally , I decide , use sanitary pad myself .
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
Armstrong . Then Tenzing &#91; and &#93; Hillary , in Everest , like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe .
I wore a sanitary pad . I filled animal blood in a football bottle , I tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while I &apos;m walking , while I &apos;m cycling , I made a press , doses of blood will go there .
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . That five days I &apos;ll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
But here the problem is , one company is making napkin out of cotton . It is working well .
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton . It &apos;s not working .
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
You need first funds .
Not only financial crises , but because of the sanitary pad research , I come through all sorts of problems , including a divorce notice from my wife .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls .
Finally , I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood , but even after that , you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material . Again , a stop-up .
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools , a simple machine tool like this .
In this machine , any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant , anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall .
That is my invention .
So after that , what I did , usually if anyone got a patent or an invention , immediately you want to make , convert into this .
I never did this . I dropped it just like this , because you do this , if anyone runs after money , their life will not &#91; have &#93; any beauty . It is boredom .
A lot of people making a lot of money , billion , billions of dollars accumulating .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
That &apos;s why I am giving this machine only in rural India , for rural women , because in India , &#91; you &apos;ll be &#93; surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . The rest , they &apos;re using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , &#91; saw &#93; dust , everything except sanitary pads .
It is the same in the 21st century . That &apos;s why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India .
So far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
Now I &apos;m on my seventh year sustaining against multinational , transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark .
A school dropout from Coimbatore , how he is able to sustaining ?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs .
Play video one .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : The thing I saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; Why are you using that nasty cloth ? &quot;
She replied immediately , &quot; I know about napkins , but if I start using napkins , then we have to cut our family milk budget . &quot;
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
So I decided I &apos;m going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups .
That is my idea .
AM : And previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . Now , any rural woman can .
They are performing puja .
: You just think , competing giants , even from Harvard , Oxford , is difficult .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ?
I &apos;m going to make India &#91; into &#93; a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime .
In this way I &apos;m going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I &apos;m going to create .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m not running after this bloody money .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
If you chase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Mahalakshmi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
That &apos;s all . A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad .
I am becoming a solution provider . I &apos;m very happy .
I don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe . That &apos;s why I put all the details on public domain like an open software .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
So I classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
Little educated , done this . Surplus educated , what are you going to do for the society ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
In keeping with the theme of TED2008 , professor Stephen Hawking asks some Big Questions about our universe -- How did the universe begin ? How did life begin ? Are we alone ? -- and discusses how we might go about answering them .
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
The questions I would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Up until the 1920s , everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time .
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
If we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
If not , what created the universe ?
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did ?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
First , there were the laws like Maxwell &apos;s equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe , given its state over all of space at one time .
And second , there was no question of the initial state of the universe .
We have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions .
But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe .
However , this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .
Under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space .
This removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state .
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
Moreover , we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states .
These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background , which is an imprint of the very early universe .
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence .
I now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth , so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets , of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy .
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing .
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago .
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years .
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible , which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type .
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
If it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available .
On the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been visited by aliens .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring , it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far .
Furthermore , despite an extensive search by the SETI project , we haven &apos;t heard any alien television quiz shows .
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years .
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .
This brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially , along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill .
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past .
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million .
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet Earth , but to spread out into space .
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space .
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say , personed -- space flight .
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions .
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap .
Indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe , and we are making good progress .
Thank you for listening .
Professor , if you had to guess either way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way , as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher ?
This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED .
Stephen Hawking : I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years ; otherwise we would have heard radio waves .
The alternative is that civilizations don &apos;t last very long , but destroy themselves .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
We will take it as a salutary warning , I think , for the rest of our conference this week .
Professor , we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days , too . Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why , for the loved ones of the dying , having hope for a happy ending shouldn &apos;t warrant a diagnosis of &quot; denial . &quot; She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life .
So I &apos;d like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China , the night I met my husband .
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking .
So I went to a party .
I sat down next to a stout , middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie , and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar , there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations .
What a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that I was then .
I &apos;d pump him for information , I &apos;m mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write .
I talk to him for hours .
Only months later , I discover who he really was .
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
&quot; Well , how long would you have talked to me if I told you we &apos;re in soybeans ? &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
I said , &quot; You could &apos;ve gotten me fired . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be .
He was a Chinese scholar who later , in his 60s , got a Ph.D. in Chinese history .
He spoke six languages , he played 15 musical instruments , he was a licensed pilot , he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator , he was an expert in swine nutrition , dairy cattle , Dixieland jazz , film noir , and we did travel the country , and the world , and we did have a lot of kids .
We followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
So when we found the cancer , it doesn &apos;t seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other , we believed that , if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough , and we worked hard enough , we could keep him from dying ever .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
What &apos;d he say ? He said what surgeons always say : &quot; We got it all . &quot;
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely .
It turned out to be a rare , exceedingly aggressive type , with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
And meanwhile , I &apos;m burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So a year goes by before the cancer , as cancers do , reappears , and with it comes another death sentence , this time nine months .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
It makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
And then more years pass , and the cancer begins to grow .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
The cancer begins to shrink , and for the third time , we &apos;ve dodged death .
So now I ask you , how do I feel when the time finally comes and there &apos;s another dark night , sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. ?
This time it &apos;s on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I &apos;ve never met before tells me that Terence is dying , perhaps tonight .
So what do I say when he says , &quot; What do you want me to do ? &quot;
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
It was an exhilarating fight , and I &apos;d repeat the fight today without a moment &apos;s hesitation .
We fought together , we lived together .
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious .
It was also an expensive fight .
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care , and of healthcare for all of us .
And for me , for us , we pushed the fight right over the edge , and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day : &quot; Hey , buddy , it was a hell of a ride . &quot;
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
Being a journalist , after Terence died , I wrote a book , &quot; The Cost Of Hope . &quot;
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did , why he did what he did , why everyone around us did what they did .
And what did I discover ?
Well , one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper , the advance directive , to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices .
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Both of them said the same thing : Do nothing if there is no further hope .
I knew Terence &apos;s wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own .
Yet we never got to no further hope .
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands , we just kept redefining hope .
I believed I could keep him from dying , and I &apos;d be embarrassed to say that if I hadn &apos;t seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way .
Right up until days before his death , I felt strongly and powerfully , and , you might say , irrationally , that I could keep him from dying ever .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet I will tell you that denial isn &apos;t even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through .
And I hear the medical professionals say , &quot; Well , we &apos;d like to do such-and-such , but the family &apos;s in denial .
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
Now , I think this maybe isn &apos;t a very useful way of thinking .
It &apos;s not just families either .
The medical professionals too , you out there , you &apos;re in denial too .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
You &apos;ve succeeded in everything you &apos;ve done , and having a patient die , well , that must feel like failure .
I saw it firsthand .
Just days before Terence died , his oncologist said , &quot; Tell Terence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
Days before he died .
Yet Ira Byock , the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said , &quot; You know , the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal . &quot;
So what the experts call &quot; denial , &quot; I call &quot; hope , &quot; and I &apos;d like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design .
You just redefine denial and hope , and it becomes a feature of being human .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
So we need to think more constructively about this very common , very profound and very powerful human emotion .
It &apos;s part of the human condition , and yet our system and our thinking isn &apos;t built to accommodate it .
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night , and I believed it .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
And during Terence &apos;s illness , I , we , we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too .
Giving up the fight -- for that &apos;s how it felt , it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story , our story of us as fighters , the story of us as invincible , and for the doctors , the story of themselves as healers .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
Maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .
People did mention hospice , but I wouldn &apos;t listen .
Hospice was for people who were dying , and Terence wasn &apos;t dying .
As a result , he spent just four days in hospice , which I &apos;m sure , as you all know , is a pretty typical outcome , and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end .
We have a noble path to curing the disease , patients and doctors alike , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be a noble path to dying .
Dying is seen as failing , and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together , but we didn &apos;t have a heroic narrative for letting go .
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end , and for saying goodbye , and maybe our new story will be about a hero &apos;s fight , and a hero &apos;s goodbye .
Terence loved poetry , and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
You know Mark Antony , the conquering hero , Cleopatra &apos;s guy ?
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
He &apos;s won all the fights , he &apos;s eluded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he &apos;s come to the city of Alexandria and realized he &apos;s lost .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
And he suddenly knows he &apos;s been deserted by the gods , and it &apos;s time to let go .
And the poet tells him what to do .
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye , a goodbye that &apos;s fit for a hero .
&quot; As if long-prepared , as if courageous , as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city , approach the window with a firm step , and with emotion , but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward , as a last enjoyment , listen to the sounds , the exquisite instruments of the musical troops , and bid her farewell , the Alexandria you are losing . &quot;
That &apos;s a goodbye for a man who was larger than life , a goodbye for a man for whom anything , well , almost anything , was possible , a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive .
And isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
How can we learn that people &apos;s decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly , powerfully , many times irrationally , on the slimmest of hopes ?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
It &apos;s part of our DNA as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
Juliana Machado Ferreira : The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil
Biologist Juliana Machado Ferreira , a TED Senior Fellow , talks about her work helping to save birds and other animals stolen from the wild in Brazil . Once these animals are seized from smugglers , she asks , then what ?
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna , especially birds , and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month , and transported far from their origins , to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo .
It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year , a business worth almost two billion dollars .
The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals , intended to supply the pet market , or they seize the animals directly from the people &apos;s houses , and this is how we end up , every month , with thousands of seized animals .
And for us to understand what happens with them , we &apos;re going to follow Brad .
In the eyes of many people , after the animals are seized , they say , &quot; Yay , justice has been served .
The good guys arrived , took the cute , mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers , and everyone lived happily ever after . &quot;
But did they ? Actually , no , and this is where many of our problems begin .
Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .
In Brazil , they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities , in which most of the cases , the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .
In 2002 , these centers received 45,000 animals , of which 37,000 were birds .
And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what &apos;s being trafficked .
Some lucky ones -- and among them , Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that .
And in these places they are cared for .
They train their flying , they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature , and they are able to socialize with others from the same species .
But then what ?
The Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we &apos;re talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .
Therefore , it would be too risky to release these animals , both for the released and for the natural populations .
They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation .
Following this argument , they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized .
However , this would mean having killed 26,267 birds , only in the state of São Paulo , only in 2006 .
But , some researchers , myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative .
We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health , behavior , inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations , then technically responsible releases are possible , both for the well-being of the individual , and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems , because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -- and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers , predators , preys , etc .
All of these were released by us .
On the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom .
On the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
And on the bottom , my personal favorite , the little male over there , four hours after his release he was together with a wild female .
So , this is not new , people have been doing this around the world .
But it &apos;s still a big issue in Brazil .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
We &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
So , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge .
So , I say , &quot; Let &apos;s study more , let &apos;s shed light on this issue , let &apos;s do whatever we can . &quot;
I &apos;m devoting my career to that .
And I &apos;m here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach : Talk to your neighbor , teach your children , make sure your pet is from a legal breeder .
We need to act , and act now , before these ones are the only ones left .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
We believe that we should work to be happy , but could that be backwards ? In this fast-moving and entertaining talk , psychologist Shawn Achor argues that actually happiness inspires productivity . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old , we were playing on top of a bunk bed .
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean , I &apos;m two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do , and I wanted to play war .
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
And on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry .
And on the other side were all my sister &apos;s My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge .
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon , but since my sister is not here with us today , let me tell you the true story -- -- which is my sister &apos;s a little bit on the clumsy side .
Somehow , without any help or push from her older brother at all , suddenly Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor .
Now I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground .
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible .
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy &apos;s arm just one week before ...
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet , for which I have yet to be thanked , I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn &apos;t even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior .
And I saw my sister &apos;s face , this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter &apos;s nap for which they had settled .
So I did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
And if you have children , you &apos;ve seen this hundreds of times before .
I said , &quot; Amy , Amy , wait . Don &apos;t cry . Don &apos;t cry .
Did you see how you landed ?
No human lands on all fours like that .
Amy , I think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
Now that was cheating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister , but Amy the special unicorn .
Of course , this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past .
And you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn .
And the latter won out .
Instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...
... with one broken leg .
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain .
What we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology , which is the reason that I &apos;m here today and the reason that I wake up every morning .
When I first started talking about this research outside of academia , out with companies and schools , the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph .
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph .
This graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning .
And this graph doesn &apos;t even mean anything ; it &apos;s fake data .
What we found is -- If I got this data back studying you here in the room , I would be thrilled , because there &apos;s very clearly a trend that &apos;s going on there , and that means that I can get published , which is all that really matters .
The fact that there &apos;s one weird red dot that &apos;s up above the curve , there &apos;s one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are , I saw you earlier -- that &apos;s no problem .
That &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because I can just delete that dot .
I can delete that dot because that &apos;s clearly a measurement error .
And we know that &apos;s a measurement error because it &apos;s messing up my data .
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how , in a statistically valid way , do we eliminate the weirdos .
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ?
Which is fantastic if I &apos;m trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two .
But if I &apos;m interested in potential , if I &apos;m interested in your potential , or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re creating the cult of the average with science .
If I asked a question like , &quot; How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom ? &quot;
scientists change the answer to &quot; How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? &quot;
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
Now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
We &apos;re hoping for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy session with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 , so you keep coming back over and over again .
We &apos;ll go back into your childhood if necessary , but eventually what we want to do is make you normal again .
But normal is merely average .
And what I posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average , we will remain merely average .
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers , what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say , why ?
Why is it that some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual ability , athletic ability , musical ability , creativity , energy levels , your resiliency in the face of challenge , your sense of humor ?
Whatever it is , instead of deleting you , what I want to do is study you .
Because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average , but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .
The reason this graph is important to me is , when I turn on the news , it seems like the majority of the information is not positive , in fact it &apos;s negative .
Most of it &apos;s about murder , corruption , diseases , natural disasters .
And very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
What that &apos;s doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome -- which , if you know people who &apos;ve been to medical school , during the first year of medical training , as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen , suddenly you realize you have all of them .
I have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School , and Bobo said , &quot; Shawn , I have leprosy . &quot;
Which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause .
See what we &apos;re finding is it &apos;s not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
And if we can change the lens , not only can we change your happiness , we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time .
When I applied to Harvard , I applied on a dare .
I didn &apos;t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college .
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later , they allowed me to go .
Suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
When I went there , I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well , that they &apos;d be excited to be there .
Even if you &apos;re in a classroom full of people smarter than you , you &apos;d be happy just to be in that classroom , which is what I felt .
But what I found there is , while some people experience that , when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to ; I wasn &apos;t that guy .
I was an officer of Harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years .
And what I found in my research and my teaching is that these students , no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school , two weeks later their brains were focused , not on the privilege of being there , nor on their philosophy or their physics .
Their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints .
When I first went in there , I walked into the freshmen dining hall , which is where my friends from Waco , Texas , which is where I grew up -- I know some of you have heard of it .
When they &apos;d come to visit me , they &apos;d look around , they &apos;d say , &quot; This freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; Harry Potter , &quot; which it does .
This is Hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; Harry Potter &quot; and that &apos;s Harvard .
And when they see this , they say , &quot; Shawn , why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard ?
Seriously , what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about ? &quot;
Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness .
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if I know everything about your external world , I can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world .
And if we change it , if we change our formula for happiness and success , what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality .
What we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by I.Q.
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat .
I talked to a boarding school up in New England , probably the most prestigious boarding school , and they said , &quot; We already know that .
So every year , instead of just teaching our students , we also have a wellness week .
And we &apos;re so excited . Monday night we have the world &apos;s leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
And Friday night we &apos;re trying to decide between risky sex or happiness . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s most people &apos;s Friday nights . &quot;
Which I &apos;m glad you liked , but they did not like that at all .
Silence on the phone .
And into the silence , I said , &quot; I &apos;d be happy to speak at your school , but just so you know , that &apos;s not a wellness week , that &apos;s a sickness week .
What you &apos;ve done is you &apos;ve outlined all the negative things that can happen , but not talked about the positive . &quot;
The absence of disease is not health .
Here &apos;s how we get to health : We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .
In the last three years , I &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn .
And what I found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : If I work harder , I &apos;ll be more successful .
And if I &apos;m more successful , then I &apos;ll be happier .
That undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior .
And the problem is it &apos;s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
First , every time your brain has a success , you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like .
You got good grades , now you have to get better grades , you got into a good school and after you get into a better school , you got a good job , now you have to get a better job , you hit your sales target , we &apos;re going to change your sales target .
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success , your brain never gets there .
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
And that &apos;s because we think we have to be successful , then we &apos;ll be happier .
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order .
If you can raise somebody &apos;s level of positivity in the present , then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage , which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative , neutral or stressed .
Your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise .
In fact , what we &apos;ve found is that every single business outcome improves .
Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present , then our brains work even more successfully as we &apos;re able to work harder , faster and more intelligently .
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .
Because dopamine , which floods into your system when you &apos;re positive , has two functions .
Not only does it make you happier , it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way .
We &apos;ve found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully .
We &apos;ve done these things in research now in every single company that I &apos;ve worked with , getting them to write down three new things that they &apos;re grateful for for 21 days in a row , three new things each day .
And at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first .
Journaling about one positive experience you &apos;ve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it .
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we &apos;ve been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand .
And finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness .
We get people , when they open up their inbox , to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network .
And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies , what we &apos;ve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success , and in doing so , not only create ripples of positivity , but create a real revolution .
Thank you very much .
Dan Ariely : What makes us feel good about our work ?
What motivates us to work ? Contrary to conventional wisdom , it isn &apos;t just money . But it &apos;s not exactly joy either . It seems that most of us thrive by making constant progress and feeling a sense of purpose . Behavioral economist Dan Ariely presents two eye-opening experiments that reveal our unexpected and nuanced attitudes toward meaning in our work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work .
When we think about how people work , the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money , and the moment we give people money , we can direct them to work one way , we can direct them to work another way .
This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like .
At the same time , if you think about it , there &apos;s all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us .
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
If you read books of people who climb mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
No , they are full of misery .
In fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
And if people were just trying to be happy , the moment they would get to the top , they would say , &quot; This was a terrible mistake .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
&quot; Instead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos . &quot;
But instead , people go down , and after they recover , they go up again .
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example , it suggests all kinds of things .
It suggests that we care about reaching the end , a peak .
It suggests that we care about the fight , about the challenge .
It suggests that there &apos;s all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways .
And for me personally , I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me .
This was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier .
And he came one day back to campus .
And he told me the following story : He said that for more than two weeks , he was working on a PowerPoint presentation .
He was working in a big bank .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
And he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs , tables , information .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the day before it was due , he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss , and his boss wrote him back and said , &quot; Nice presentation , but the merger is canceled . &quot;
And the guy was deeply depressed .
Now at the moment when he was working , he was actually quite happy .
Every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation .
But knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed .
So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor .
And to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos , and we asked them to build with Legos .
And for some people , we gave them Legos and we said , &quot; Hey , would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars ?
We &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
And people said yes , and they built with these Legos .
And when they finished , we took it , we put it under the table , and we said , &quot; Would you like to build another one , this time for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
If they said yes , we gave them another one .
And when they finished , we asked them , &quot; Do you want to build another one ? &quot; for $ 2.40 , $ 2.10 , and so on , until at some point people said , &quot; No more . It &apos;s not worth it for me . &quot;
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
People built one Bionicle after another .
After they finished every one of them , we put them under the table .
And we told them that at the end of the experiment , we will take all these Bionicles , we will disassemble them , we will put them back in the boxes , and we will use it for the next participant .
There was another condition .
This other condition was inspired by David , my student .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if you remember the story about Sisyphus , Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work .
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
Also , if you look at prison movies , sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished , they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again .
There &apos;s something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating .
So in the second condition of this experiment , that &apos;s exactly what we did .
We asked people , &quot; Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars ? &quot;
And if they said yes , they built it .
Then we asked them , &quot; Do you want to build another one for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
And if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
And when they finished that , we said , &quot; Would you like to build another one , this time for 30 cents less ? &quot;
And if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
So this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes .
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven -- in the meaningful condition versus the Sisyphus condition .
And by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
People were building Bionicles for a few cents .
And not only that , everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
But even the small meaning made a difference .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
In this other version of the experiment , we didn &apos;t put people in this situation , we just described to them the situation , much as I am describing to you now , and we asked them to predict what the result would be .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle .
So people understand that meaning is important , they just don &apos;t understand the magnitude of the importance , the extent to which it &apos;s important .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
If you think about it , there are some people who love Legos and some people who don &apos;t .
And you would speculate that the people who love Legos will build more Legos , even for less money , because after all , they get more internal joy from it .
And the people who love Legos less will build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower .
And that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
There was a very nice correlation between love of Lego and the amount of Legos people built .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
There was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built , which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people &apos;s eyes , we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity .
We basically eliminated it .
Soon after I finished running this experiment , I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle .
I can &apos;t tell you who they were , but they were a big company in Seattle .
And this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building .
And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company .
And the week before I showed up , the CEO of this big software company went to that group , 200 engineers , and canceled the project .
And I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I &apos;ve ever talked to .
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
And I asked them , I said , &quot; How many of you now show up to work later than you used to ? &quot;
And everybody raised their hand .
I said , &quot; How many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
And everybody raised their hand .
I asked them , &quot; How many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t really raise their hands , but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports .
And then I asked them , I said , &quot; What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed ? &quot;
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do .
He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization .
He could have asked them to build some prototypes , some next-generation prototypes , and seen how they would work .
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation .
And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
If the CEO , just like our participants , thought the essence of meaning is unimportant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
And he would tell them , &quot; At the moment I directed you in this way , and now that I am directing you in this way , everything will be okay . &quot;
But if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
The next experiment was slightly different .
We took a sheet of paper with random letters , and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money , and so on and so forth .
And we had three conditions .
In the first condition , people wrote their name on the sheet , found all the pairs of letters , gave it to the experimenter .
The experimenter would look at it , scan it from top to bottom , say &quot; uh huh &quot; and put it on the pile next to them .
In the second condition , people did not write their name on it .
The experimenter looked at it , took the sheet of paper , did not look at it , did not scan it , and simply put it on the pile of pages .
So you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
And in the third condition , the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder .
What happened in those three conditions ?
In this plot I &apos;m showing you at what pay rate people stopped .
So low numbers mean that people worked harder . They worked for much longer .
In the acknowledged condition , people worked all the way down to 15 cents .
At 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
In the shredder condition , it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet .
And this is basically the result we had before .
You shred people &apos;s efforts , output , you get them not to be as happy with what they &apos;re doing .
But I should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
They could have done not so good work , because they realized that people were just shredding it .
So maybe the first sheet you would do good work , but then you see nobody is really testing it , so you would do more and more and more .
So in fact , in the shredder condition , people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it .
But what about the ignored condition ?
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder , or somewhere in the middle ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done , scanning it and saying &quot; uh huh , &quot; that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people &apos;s motivations .
So the good news is that adding motivation doesn &apos;t seem to be so difficult .
The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy , and if we don &apos;t think about it carefully , we might overdo it .
So this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation .
The next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble .
And I don &apos;t know about you , but every time I assemble one of those , it takes me much longer , it &apos;s much more effortful , it &apos;s much more confusing .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
But when I finish it , I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
So when they started cake mixes in the &apos; 40s , they would take this powder and they would put it in a box , and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in , stir some water in it , mix it , put it in the oven , and -- voila ! -- you had cake .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , &quot; Here is my cake . &quot;
No , no , no , it was somebody else &apos;s cake .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
You had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
Now it was your cake . Now everything was fine .
Now I think a little bit like the IKEA effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they &apos;re doing to a higher degree .
So how do we look at this question experimentally ?
We asked people to build some origami .
We gave them instructions on how to create origami , and we gave them a sheet of paper .
And these were all novices , and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane .
But then we told them , we said , &quot; Look , this origami really belongs to us .
You worked for us , but I &apos;ll tell you what , we &apos;ll sell it to you .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it .
And we had two types of people .
We had the people who built it , and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers .
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami , and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally .
Now you could say , if you were a builder , do you think that , &quot; Oh , I love this origami , but I know that nobody else would love it ? &quot;
Or do you think , &quot; I love this origami , and everybody else will love it as well ? &quot;
Which one of those two is correct ?
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more , they thought that everybody would see the world in their view .
They thought everybody else would love it more as well .
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
At the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami .
For some people we just eliminated that .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
Well in an objective way , the origami now was uglier , it was more difficult .
Now when we looked at the easy origami , we saw the same thing : Builders loved it more , evaluators loved it less .
When you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
Why ? Because now the builders loved it even more .
They put all this extra effort into it .
And evaluators ? They loved it even less .
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
Of course , this tells you something about how we evaluate things .
Now think about kids .
Imagine I asked you , &quot; How much would you sell your kids for ? &quot;
Your memories and associations and so on .
Most people would say for a lot , a lot of money -- on good days .
But imagine this was slightly different .
Imagine if you did not have your kids , and one day you went to the park and you met some kids , and they were just like your kids .
And you played with them for a few hours .
And when you were about to leave , the parents said , &quot; Hey , by the way , just before you leave , if you &apos;re interested , they &apos;re for sale . &quot;
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
And this is because our kids are so valuable , not just because of who they are , but because of us , because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection .
And by the way , if you think that IKEA instructions are not good , think about the instructions that come with kids .
Those are really tough .
By the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
Which comes to tell you one more thing , which is , much like our builders , when they look at the creature of their creation , we don &apos;t see that other people don &apos;t see things our way .
Let me say one last comment .
If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx , Adam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency .
He gave an example of a pin factory .
He said pins have 12 different steps , and if one person does all 12 steps , production is very low .
But if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on , production can increase tremendously .
And indeed , this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency .
Karl Marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
And if you make all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
But if you make one step every time , maybe you don &apos;t care as much .
And I think that in the Industrial Revolution , Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
And you can ask yourself , what happens in a knowledge economy ?
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort , attention , caring , how connected they feel to it , are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on , all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us .
So when we think about labor , we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing , but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it -- meaning , creation , challenges , ownership , identity , pride , etc .
And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . But few people are using them . Why ? &quot; Reformed marketer &quot; Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy .
I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development .
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is the &#91; second &#93; largest country in Africa .
In fact , it &apos;s as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
The DRC is a dangerous place .
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east .
But war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .
There are many health issues as well .
In fact , the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults .
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
And due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
Which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
And so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Damien .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
Now Damien knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
It &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms .
Joseph and Christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers don &apos;t buy the branded versions .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms : fear , financing and fidelity .
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; to live &quot; or Trust .
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
Sex !
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this .
Their marketing is slightly different .
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is .
Some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
And for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
It &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
But if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives depend on it .
And so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
As Vicki Arroyo says , it &apos;s time to prepare our homes and cities for our changing climate , with its increased risk of flooding , drought and uncertainty . She illustrates this inspiring talk with bold projects from cities all over the world -- local examples of thinking ahead .
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans .
It was a great place to grow up , but it &apos;s one of the most vulnerable spots in the world .
Half the city is already below sea level .
In 2005 , the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina .
One thousand , eight hundred and thirty-six people died . Nearly 300,000 homes were lost .
These are my mother &apos;s , at the top -- although that &apos;s not her car , it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof -- and that &apos;s my sister &apos;s , below .
Fortunately , they and other family members got out in time , but they lost their homes , and as you can see , just about everything in them .
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways .
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar .
Climate change is affecting our homes , our communities , our way of life . We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity .
This talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the Earth .
The changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equally .
There are important distributional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think .
In New Orleans , the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable .
For those in vulnerable , low-lying nations , how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried ? And where will your people go ?
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
Will there be tensions over immigration , or conflicts over competition for limited resources ?
It &apos;s already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur .
Like it or not , ready or not , this is our future .
Sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
That &apos;s the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice .
But while there might be some short-term individual winners , our collective losses will far outweigh them .
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events .
The military gets it . They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security , while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond .
So what can we do ? How can we prepare and adapt ?
I &apos;d like to share three sets of examples , starting with adapting to violent storms and floods .
In New Orleans , the I-10 Twin Spans , with sections knocked out in Katrina , have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge .
And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward .
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher , it &apos;s poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country .
They &apos;re selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels , reflective paint and more .
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
For example , in Galveston , here &apos;s a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not .
And around the world , satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh .
But as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
We need better planning and systems for evacuation .
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why .
While it &apos;s true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation , others who did refused to leave as the storm approached , often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets .
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
Fortunately in 2006 , Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act — it spells &quot; PETS &quot; — to change that .
Second , preparing for heat and drought .
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa , from Australia to Oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003 , and again in Russia in 2010 .
In Ethiopia , 70 percent , that &apos;s 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
Oxfam and Swiss Re , together with Rockefeller Foundation , are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water , but they &apos;re also providing for insurance when the droughts do come .
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest .
It &apos;s giving them access to affordable credit .
It &apos;s allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time , without assistance .
It &apos;s a virtuous cycle , and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world .
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues , Chicago became a recognized leader , tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers , outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods , planting trees , creating cool white or vegetated green roofs .
This is City Hall &apos;s green roof , next to Cook County &apos;s &#91; portion of the &#93; roof , which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface .
Washington , D.C. , last year , actually led the nation in new green roofs installed , and they &apos;re funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags .
They &apos;re splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners .
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff .
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
Third , adapting to rising seas .
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta .
That &apos;s where half of Vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
It makes sense , right ? There &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
Here &apos;s just one example , San Francisco Airport , with 16 inches or more of flooding .
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine . For example , planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated , less dense air , provides for less lift .
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system .
Beyond these technical solutions , our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change .
For example , in land use , which areas do you want to protect , through adding a seawall , for example , alter , by raising buildings , or retreat from , to allow the migration of important natural systems , such as wetlands or beaches ?
Other examples to consider . In the U.K. , the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge .
The Asian Cities Climate &#91; Change &#93; Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves .
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities .
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms , as you can see from this clever sign , and to sea level rise , and to storm surge , as you can see from the subway flooding .
But back above ground , these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive . In fact , in New York , San Francisco and London , designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind .
I think these are inspiring examples of what &apos;s possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different .
But now , a word of caution .
Adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
We &apos;re entering uncharted territory , and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past .
&quot; Stationarity &quot; is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past , and plan accordingly , and this principle governs much of our engineering , our design of critical infrastructure , city water systems , building codes , even water rights and other legal precedents .
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
We &apos;re operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
It &apos;s up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that . Humans age in seven basic ways , he says , all of which can be averted .
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so I &apos;m going to dive straight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work .
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we have to get our shit together , and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .
I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging .
And then I &apos;m going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
The first one I &apos;m going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I &apos;m going to define as 30 years , applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .
Namely , essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
And of course , the last thing I &apos;m going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
That was easy . OK .
OK . Hands up : anyone in the audience who &apos;s not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
That &apos;s very good news , because I thought that was what the answer would be .
Now the thing is , I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
And here is that characteristic .
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .
Now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially , to talk about the comparison with foxhunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago .
I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .
And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me .
You know , a lot of people said , &quot; Well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
It &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
It &apos;s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . &quot;
But ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the British public , and certainly the majority of members of Parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s not just about life , of course -- -- it &apos;s about healthy life , you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun .
So really , this is how I would like to describe it .
It &apos;s a global trance .
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging .
And , I mean , OK , I &apos;m not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless .
There are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .
But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of proportion .
You know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about .
But the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
You know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong , then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what I say .
Now , there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is .
People worry about overpopulation ; they say , &quot; Well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing St. Giles carelessly .
And therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . &quot;
And that &apos;s true .
And you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
I don &apos;t agree with those answers . I think they basically don &apos;t work .
I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect .
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate , or a high death rate .
A high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies , in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .
And , I say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
If we vacillate , hesitate , and do not actually develop these therapies , then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies , but will not be , because we haven &apos;t developed them as quickly as we could -- we &apos;ll be denying those people an indefinite life span , and I consider that that is immoral .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
Aging is ghastly , but it &apos;s inevitable , so , you know , we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it &apos;s rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
But of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem .
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I &apos;m giving here .
A very simple definition .
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism .
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms , because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect .
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
That &apos;s a fine definition . So we can put it this way : we can say that , you know , we have this chain of events .
And there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
They &apos;re what I &apos;m calling here the &quot; gerontology approach &quot; and the &quot; geriatrics approach . &quot;
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .
Of course , it &apos;s a very short-term-ist strategy ; it &apos;s a losing battle , because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on .
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure .
But unfortunately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand metabolism very well .
In fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we &apos;re not really too good on yet .
We &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
Basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
So then , what do we do about that ?
I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
But it isn &apos;t .
Before I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m calling step two .
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire -- let &apos;s say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 55 .
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; robust human rejuvenation . &quot; OK .
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live ?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it &apos;s simple , but it &apos;s not simple .
We can &apos;t just say , &quot; Well , if they &apos;re young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they &apos;ll live 30 years longer . &quot;
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
There are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose .
There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs .
Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames .
Fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .
We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
Computers : you can look at a more or less parallel time line , happening of course a bit later .
You can look at medical care . I mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
That in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp .
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game .
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
I &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
They &apos;ll never be perfect , but we &apos;ll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of , before we have any 200-year-olds .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot;
Well , it seems to get the point across .
So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
If you &apos;re already 100 , or even if you &apos;re 80 -- and an average 80-year-old , we probably can &apos;t do a lot for you with these therapies , because you &apos;re too close to death &apos;s door for the really initial , experimental therapies to be good enough for you .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
But if you &apos;re only 50 , then there &apos;s a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .
And of course , if you &apos;re a bit younger than that , then you &apos;re never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year-old -- we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these first-generation therapies .
But irrespective of that age , I &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
Alright , so finally I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the talk , my last seven-and-a-half minutes , on step one ; namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
I &apos;m calling it &quot; robust mouse rejuvenation , &quot; not very imaginatively .
And this is what it is .
I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average .
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday .
So , in other words , we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan , starting from the point that we started the therapies .
The question then is , what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ?
Which we can now , as I &apos;ve explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .
Secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
And thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
One has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame , in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities .
So , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
And finally , of course , I think it &apos;s fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier , the coping strategy .
That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice .
So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these mice , I &apos;m going to add a little bit to my description of aging .
I &apos;m going to use this word &quot; damage &quot; to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology .
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we &apos;re born .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
We can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .
And I &apos;m going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment .
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
And the reason it &apos;s a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .
So there &apos;s a third approach , if we look at it this way .
We can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and I claim that the engineering approach is within range .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a losing battle , and it &apos;s something that we are within range of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t involve improving on evolution .
The engineering approach simply says , &quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
We know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
Why do I say that we &apos;re in range ? Well , this is basically it .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
It &apos;s a list of types of pathology that are age-related , and it &apos;s just an incomplete list .
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology .
And there are only seven of them .
They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them .
Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
One can say , &quot; OK , what are we made of ? &quot;
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
So , these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news , because it means that , you know , we &apos;ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years , so the fact that we haven &apos;t extended this list is a pretty good indication that there &apos;s no extension to be done .
However , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
I haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it .
We do need to really start trying .
So of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
I &apos;ve published a great deal on this ; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based , and there &apos;s quite a lot of detail there .
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I &apos;m predicting here .
So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better damn well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong .
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .
So , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
One thing is , you know , you &apos;ll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time , and everyone said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s obviously impossible . &quot;
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
We have various strategies -- there &apos;s the Methuselah Mouse Prize , which is basically an incentive to innovate , and to do what you think is going to work , and you get money for it if you win .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
But , I mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?
Not very long . OK .
It &apos;s got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this .
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
OK . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
Audience : Since you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it , why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 .
Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die .
So , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for
